# OnlyiGaming – News Navigation → Tag Mapping (Wireframe Reference)

**Purpose of this document**
This document defines **exactly which tags appear under each MAIN NEWS CATEGORY**. It is written specifically for **UX / wireframes / IA**, not for backend architecture.

Use this when deciding:
- What filters appear in each News section
- What labels are visible to users
- What content loads by default

---

## Key rules (important for wireframes)

- **Main categories are navigation buckets** (not tags)
- **Users never see tag IDs**
