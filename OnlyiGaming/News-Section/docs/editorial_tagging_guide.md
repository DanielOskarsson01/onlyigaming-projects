# PART 6: TAGGING BEST PRACTICES

## General Rules

1. **Apply 4-6 tags per article** - Enough for discoverability, not so many as to dilute relevance
2. **Always include at least one NEWS tag** - Every article should have a primary topic
3. **Add DIR tags when companies are central** - If the article is about specific business types
4. **Add PROD tags for vertical relevance** - Helps users filtering by gaming type
5. **Add GEO tags for location-specific news** - Enables geographic filtering
6. **Add TYPE tags for format** - Helps surface interviews, analysis, etc.

## Common Combinations

| Article Type | Typical Tag Combination |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Acquisition news | NEWS-002 + DIR-xxx (acquirer type) + GEO-xx |
| New slot launch | NEWS-011 + DIR-029 + PROD-001 |
| Regulatory fine | NEWS-009 + GEO-xx + PROD-xxx |
| CEO interview | NEWS-001 + TYPE-003 + DIR-xxx |
| Market report | NEWS-022 + TYPE-009 + GEO-xx |
| Live casino studio news | NEWS-xxx + DIR-033 + PROD-010 |

## Edge Cases

### Article mentions multiple companies from different categories
Tag all relevant DIR categories, but prioritize the main subject.

### Article spans multiple regions
Use the most specific GEO tag possible. If truly global, use GEO-GLOBAL.

### News vs Opinion
If content includes editorial commentary but is primarily news, use NEWS tag. Only use TYPE-004 (Opinion) if the piece is primarily opinion.

### Partnership vs M&A
- Partnership = Companies remain independent (NEWS-015)
- M&A = Ownership changes (NEWS-002)

### Sponsorship vs Partnership
- Sponsorship = Brand/marketing relationship with sports/entertainment (NEWS-033)
- Partnership = Business/commercial relationship (NEWS-015)
