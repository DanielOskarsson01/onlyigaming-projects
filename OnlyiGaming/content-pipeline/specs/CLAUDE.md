# CLAUDE.md — Content Creation Tool v2 (Skeleton Repo)

## ⛔ STOP — READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE

You are building the skeleton infrastructure for an 11-step content creation wizard. This repo is the BUILDING — walls, wiring, plumbing, doors. Submodules (the furniture) live in a separate repo.

---

## 📂 File System — CRITICAL

### Active repos (ALL work happens here):
- **Skeleton:** `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-v2/`
- **Modules:** `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-modules-v2/`

### Archived (READ-ONLY, never write to):
- **v1 original:** `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/content-pipeline/`

### Specs (READ-ONLY reference):
- `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/Content-Pipeline/specs/`

**Phase 0 creates the v2 repos from scratch. The original repo stays at its current path as a READ-ONLY reference. V1 files are audited just-in-time in each phase — never bulk-copied. If you find yourself writing to `content-pipeline/` (without -v2), STOP — you are in the wrong directory.**

---

## 🧭 How You Work

### MANDATORY: Plan Before You Code

For EVERY phase:
1. **Read** the spec sections referenced in that phase
2. **Audit** any v1 files listed in the phase's "V1 Audit" section (open → compare against spec → decide REUSE/FIX/FRESH)
3. **Present a plan** listing: which files you'll create, which v1 files you'll reuse/fix, and what each change does
4. **Wait for approval** before writing any code
5. **Execute** the approved plan
6. **Verify** against the deliverables checklist

**NEVER skip the plan step.** If you start coding without presenting a plan first, you are doing it wrong.

### Phase Gating

You may ONLY work on the current phase. Check the `CURRENT PHASE` marker at the bottom of this file.

- Do NOT start the next phase until told to
- Do NOT "prepare" things for future phases
- Do NOT stub or scaffold future work
- If you discover the current phase needs something from a future phase, STOP and flag it

### When Existing Code Contradicts the Spec

The spec ALWAYS wins. Rewrite the code to match the spec. Do not adapt the spec to match existing code.

## 📚 Required Reading (in order)

| Document | Location | What it tells you |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| SKELETON_SPEC_v2.md | specs/ | Architecture, components, data flow, database schema — THE source of truth |
| BUILD_PLAN.md | specs/ | Phased build sequence, what to copy vs build vs delete |
| UI_REFERENCE.md | specs/ | Visual specs for every component, what changes vs stays, ownership model |
| STRATEGIC_ARCHITECTURE.md | specs/ | Governing strategy (read once for context) |

**Before each phase:** Re-read the specific Parts of SKELETON_SPEC referenced in BUILD_PLAN for that phase.

## 🚫 Rules — Never Break These

### Architecture Rules
1. **No submodule-specific logic in this repo.** Ever. If you're writing code that only applies to one submodule, it belongs in the modules repo.
2. **No hardcoded step content.** Step names, descriptions, categories — all come from STEP_CONFIG or manifests. Never from component code.
3. **Universal step template for Steps 1–10.** One component renders all of them. There is no Step1Discovery.tsx, no Step2Validation.tsx.
4. **Skeleton renders slots. Modules fill them.** The only module-provided React component is the Options accordion slot. Everything else is skeleton-rendered using data/schema from modules.

### State Management Rules
5. **Zustand = UI state ONLY.** Which panel is open, which accordion is expanded, toast messages. NEVER domain data (projects, runs, entities).
6. **TanStack Query = ALL server data.** Projects, runs, steps, submodule results — all fetched and cached via TanStack Query.
7. **No fetch() in components.** All API calls go through hooks in `client/src/hooks/`. Components call hooks, never fetch directly.

### UI Rules (from UI_REFERENCE.md)
8. **Keep the existing visual design.** Colors, fonts, spacing, border styles, rounded corners — no changes unless UI_REFERENCE.md explicitly says to change it.
9. **SubmodulePanel: fixed 480px width.** Never resizes. `w-[480px] min-w-[480px] max-w-[480px]`.
10. **SubmodulePanel: one accordion open at a time.** Opening one closes the others.
11. **StepSummary: per-submodule rows, NOT an aggregate summary.** Each submodule provides its own summary content. Skeleton provides the container.
12. **Submodule rows show (left to right):** Data op toggle (➕➖＝) → checkbox → status dot → name + result count → description → arrow →.
13. **Results accordion action CTAs:** Change Input, Change Options, Download, Try again. These are at the bottom of the results list inside the accordion.
14. **CTA Footer (panel bottom):** RUN TASK, SEE RESULTS, APPROVE. Always visible, activation based on state.

### Code Quality Rules
15. **Each phase must compile and run.** No broken builds between phases. `npm run dev` must work after every phase.
16. **No TODO/FIXME stubs for future phases.** If it's not needed now, don't write it.
17. **No silent modifications to previous phases.** If Phase 5 needs a Phase 2 change, flag it and wait for approval.

## ✅ Architecture Self-Check

Run these before committing. All should return nothing:

```bash
# Stores must NOT contain domain data
grep -rn "entities\|projects:\s*\[\|selectedProjectId\|submodules:\s*\[" client/src/stores/ || echo "PASS: No domain data in stores"

# Components must NOT fetch directly  
grep -rn "fetch(\|axios\|supabase\." client/src/components/ || echo "PASS: No direct fetching in components"

# No step-specific components (should all be deleted)
ls client/src/components/steps/Step[0-9]*.tsx 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: Step-specific components exist" || echo "PASS: No step-specific components"

# No step-specific stores
ls client/src/stores/*discovery*  client/src/stores/*validation* 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: Step-specific stores exist" || echo "PASS: No step-specific stores"
```

## 🔄 Ownership Model (what renders what)

| Component | Skeleton owns | Module provides |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Step accordion expand/collapse | ✅ | — |
| Category card grid | ✅ | Categories from manifest |
| Submodule rows (checkbox, status, data op) | ✅ | Status from submodule_runs |
| StepSummary container | ✅ area + data flow | Summary text per submodule |
| Panel header, description, data op indicator | ✅ | manifest fields |
| Input accordion (upload, preview, auto-resolve) | ✅ | — |
| Options accordion container | ✅ | React component OR options[] from manifest |
| Results accordion (list, checkboxes, pagination, CTAs) | ✅ via ContentRenderer | Data + output_schema |
| CTA footer | ✅ | — |

## 📋 Phase Checklist Reference

Detailed phase steps and deliverables are in **BUILD_PLAN.md**. Read that document for each phase.

Summary:
- **Phase 0:** Create empty v2 repos, copy inert config (vite/tailwind/tsconfig), seed modules, minimal main.tsx + server.js, git init
- **Phase 1:** Header bar, routing (3 pages), placeholder content
- **Phase 2:** Step 0 form, Supabase tables (projects, pipeline_runs, pipeline_stages), projects list
- **Phase 3:** Run View, vertical step accordion, Step 0 approval, universal step template (empty)
- **Phase 4:** Module auto-discovery, manifest reading, real category cards
- **Phase 5:** SubmodulePanel shell (3 accordions placeholder, CTA footer, data op toggle)
- **Phase 6:** Input accordion internals, Options accordion internals, file upload, ContentRenderer
- **Phase 7:** BullMQ execution, Results accordion, approval flow, working pool
- **Phase 8:** Step-to-step data flow, step approval aggregation, skip step
- **Phase 9:** First real submodules (in modules repo)
- **Phase 10:** Polish, error states, edge cases

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building the results table inside the skeleton as a fixed component.** The skeleton uses ContentRenderer which reads render_schema from the module's output_schema. Different modules produce different displays (url_list, table, content_cards, file_list).

2. **Putting the summary as one aggregate line.** StepSummary shows one row PER submodule, each with its own content from the module. Not "728 items total."

3. **Making the Options accordion a skeleton form.** Options is a SLOT. The module provides either a custom React component (options_component) or an options[] array that the skeleton auto-renders. If neither exists, show "No options."

4. **Hardcoding categories.** Categories come from the `category` field in submodule manifests. The skeleton groups by this field dynamically.

5. **Forgetting the action CTAs in Results.** Below the item list: Change Input, Change Options, Download, Try again. These are NOT in the footer — they're inside the Results accordion.

6. **Making the panel resizable or responsive.** Panel is exactly 480px. Always.

7. **Allowing multiple accordions open in the panel.** One at a time. Opening one closes the other.

8. **Working in the wrong directory.** The original `content-pipeline/` is a READ-ONLY reference. ALL work happens in `content-pipeline-v2/`. If your path doesn't end in `-v2/`, you're in the wrong place.
