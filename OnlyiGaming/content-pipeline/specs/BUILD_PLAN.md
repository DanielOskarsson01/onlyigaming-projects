# Content Creation Tool — Build Plan

> **Version:** 2.0 — February 10, 2026
> **Reads from:** SKELETON_SPEC_v2.md, SUBMODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md
> **Purpose:** Phased build sequence for Claude Code. Each phase is a self-contained unit of work. Complete one phase fully before starting the next.
> **Strategy:** Clean start. Selectively copy audited files when each phase needs them.

---

## Ground Rules

### For Claude Code — READ THIS FIRST

1. **Read the spec before writing code.** Every phase references specific Parts of SKELETON_SPEC_v2.md. Read those Parts. Do not guess.
2. **Build exactly what the spec says.** Do not add features, "improve" patterns, or anticipate future needs.
3. **Cross-reference deliverables against the spec.** After building, re-read the referenced spec Parts and verify EVERY UI element, button, field, and behavior described in the spec is implemented — not just the deliverable summary lines. The deliverables are a checklist, the spec is the contract. If the spec describes it and this phase references that Part, it must be built.
4. **Do not touch previous phases.** If Phase 3 requires a change to Phase 1 code, flag it — do not silently modify.
5. **No placeholder "TODO" code.** Each phase must be functional when complete. If something isn't needed yet, don't stub it.
6. **Test each phase before moving on.** The app must compile, render, and function after every phase.

### Strategy: Clean Start + Just-in-Time Audit

The v2 repos are created EMPTY. No bulk copy. No mass delete.

**How it works:**
1. Phase 0 creates empty folder structures + copies ONLY inert config (vite, tailwind, tsconfig, package.json, etc.)
2. Each subsequent phase lists v1 files to AUDIT before building
3. For each v1 file: open it → compare against spec → decide: REUSE (copy as-is), FIX (modify then copy), or WRITE FRESH
4. Only audited, spec-compliant code enters v2

**Why this approach:**
- No leftover cruft — every file in v2 exists because it was explicitly vetted
- No premature copying — files arrive when their phase needs them
- Preserves accumulated knowledge — edge cases, debug fixes, patterns we already solved
- Claude Code never sees irrelevant v1 files that might contaminate new code

**The existing codebase is a READ-ONLY reference.** Located at:
`/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/content-pipeline/`

**The spec always wins.** When existing code contradicts the spec, write fresh to match the spec.

### V1 Audit Protocol (used by every phase)

When a phase lists "v1 audit" files, follow this process FOR EACH FILE:

1. **Open** the v1 file and read it fully
2. **Compare** against the spec sections referenced by the current phase
3. **Decide:**
   - **REUSE** → File matches spec. Copy to v2 target path as-is.
   - **FIX** → File is mostly right but has spec deviations. Fix in a temp location, then copy to v2.
   - **WRITE FRESH** → File is too far from spec or too tangled with v1 patterns. Write new code from spec.
4. **Log** the decision for each file (print: "filename → REUSE/FIX/FRESH — reason")
5. **Never copy a v1 file without reading it first**

### Two Repos — Physical Separation

```
content-pipeline-v2/              ← Skeleton repo (clean start)
content-pipeline-modules-v2/      ← Modules repo (new)
```

Both repos live under: `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/`

The v2 repos live inside the OnlyiGaming project folder. Specs live ONLY in `Content-Pipeline/specs/` (single source of truth). The skeleton repo does NOT have its own specs/ folder — it reads from the project folder.

Source repo (READ-ONLY reference): `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/content-pipeline/`
Specs location: `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/Content-Pipeline/specs/`

### Tech Stack (from Spec Part 20)

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Server state:** TanStack Query
- **UI state:** Zustand
- **Tables:** TanStack Table (when needed, Phase 6+)
- **Backend:** Express.js + Node.js 20 LTS
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Job queue:** Redis + BullMQ (Phase 7+)
- **Process manager:** PM2 (production only)

---

## V1 Codebase Reference Map

These tables catalog every v1 file and its expected disposition. They are NOT a Phase 0 checklist — files are audited just-in-time when each phase needs them. Each phase's "V1 Audit" section lists which files to open from this map.

Source repo (READ-ONLY): `/Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/content-pipeline/`

### Likely REUSE (expected to pass audit as-is)
| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `client/src/stores/appStore.ts` | Toast + activeTab, clean Zustand, identical to v2 needs |
| `client/src/stores/panelStore.ts` | Panel visibility + accordion state, matches v2 spec |
| `client/src/components/layout/Toast.tsx` | Works perfectly |
| `client/src/api/client.ts` | apiFetch wrapper, queryClient setup, error handling. API shapes change but plumbing stays |
| `client/src/hooks/useUrlParams.ts` | URL-based project/run routing |
| `services/db.js` | Supabase client, 12 lines |
| `client/vite.config.ts` | Build config |
| `client/tailwind.config.js` | Tailwind config |
| `client/tsconfig.json` + `tsconfig.app.json` + `tsconfig.node.json` | TypeScript config |
| `client/postcss.config.js` | PostCSS config |
| `client/package.json` | Dependencies (React 18, TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind, Vite) |
| `package.json` (root) | Server dependencies (Express, BullMQ, Supabase, ioredis) |

| `client/src/components/shared/CategoryCardGrid.tsx` | Add status-based display (idle/running/has_results/approved), spinner, data operation icon (➕➖＝) |
| `client/src/components/shared/SubmodulePanel.tsx` | Fix to spec's three fixed accordions (Input/Options/Results), spec-exact CTA button logic, data operation toggle |
| `client/src/components/steps/StepContainer.tsx` | Become universal step template — add auto-discovery trigger, working pool display, skip button |
| `client/src/hooks/useSubmodules.ts` | Keep mutation/query patterns, update API shapes to match spec Part 16 |
| `client/src/hooks/useStepContext.ts` | Keep concept, update to v2 step_context table shape |
| `client/src/stores/pipelineStore.ts` | Drop hardcoded category lists, become generic step expansion tracker |
| `client/src/types/step.ts` | Update types to match spec |
| `client/src/router.tsx` | Update routes: /new, /projects, /projects/:id/runs/:runId |
| `client/src/App.tsx` | Simplify to RouterProvider only (routing handles layout) |
| `server.js` | Remove WebSocket code, keep Express setup |
| `routes/submodules.js` | Module loading + execution patterns transferable, update API shapes per spec Part 16 |
| `routes/projects.js` | Keep CRUD, update to v2 schema |
| `workers/stageWorker.js` | Keep BullMQ pattern, update execution model to v2 |

### SKIP (never copy — v1-only, replaced by v2 architecture)
| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `client/src/components/steps/Step1Discovery.tsx` | Replaced by universal step template |
| `client/src/components/steps/Step2Validation.tsx` | Replaced by universal step template |
| `client/src/components/panels/Step1Panel.tsx` | Replaced by universal pane template |

| `client/src/stores/validationStore.ts` | Step-specific store, replaced by universal pattern |
| `services/orchestrator.js` | v2 has different orchestration model |
| `services/entityService.js` | v2 doesn't use entities table same way |

| `middleware/errorHandler.js` | v1-only middleware |
| `utils/aiProvider.js` | v1-only, future tools.ai |
| `utils/browser.js` | v1-only |
| `routes/health.js` | Phase 0 creates inline health endpoint |

## Phase 0 — Repo Scaffold (Clean Start)

**Goal:** Two empty repos exist with correct folder structures. Inert config files copied. Seed modules in place. Dev server runs.

**Spec reference:** Part 20 (Tech Stack), Part 2 (Repo Structure)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read the referenced spec Parts. Every folder, config file, and structural decision described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### Steps

**⚠️ FILE SYSTEM CLARITY: Do these steps IN ORDER. No skipping.**

1. **Create skeleton repo** with empty folder structure:
   ```
   /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-v2/
   ├── client/
   │   └── src/
   │       ├── api/
   │       ├── components/
   │       │   ├── layout/
   │       │   ├── shared/
   │       │   ├── steps/
   │       │   ├── primitives/
   │       │   └── pages/
   │       ├── config/
   │       ├── hooks/
   │       ├── stores/
   │       └── types/
   ├── server/
   │   ├── routes/
   │   ├── services/
   │   └── workers/
   ├── sql/
   └── specs/
   ```

2. **Create modules repo** with seed modules:
   ```
   /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-modules-v2/
   ├── CLAUDE.md
   └── modules/
       ├── step-1-discovery/
       │   └── sitemap-parser/
       │       ├── manifest.json
       │       └── execute.js
       └── step-2-validation/
           └── url-dedup/
               ├── manifest.json
               └── execute.js
   ```

3. **Copy seed modules** from specs into modules repo:
   ```bash
   cp -r /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/Content-Pipeline/specs/seed-modules/* \
         /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-modules-v2/modules/
   ```

4. **Copy modules CLAUDE.md:**
   ```bash
   cp /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/Content-Pipeline/specs/CLAUDE_MODULES.md \
      /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-modules-v2/CLAUDE.md
   ```

5. **Specs stay in project folder — do NOT copy into code repo:**
   Specs live ONLY in `Content-Pipeline/specs/` (single source of truth).
   The skeleton repo references them via the path in CLAUDE.md but does NOT have its own copy.
   ```
   READ-ONLY reference path:
   /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/Content-Pipeline/specs/
   ```
   ⛔ Do NOT create a specs/ folder inside content-pipeline-v2/. This caused spec divergence previously.

6. **Copy skeleton CLAUDE.md** to repo root:
   ```bash
   cp /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/Content-Pipeline/specs/CLAUDE.md \
      /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-v2/CLAUDE.md
   ```

7. **Copy inert config files** from v1 repo (these are boilerplate with zero logic):
   ```
   FROM: /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/content-pipeline/
   TO:   /Users/danieloskarsson/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/OnlyiGaming/content-pipeline-v2/

   client/vite.config.ts        → client/vite.config.ts
   client/tailwind.config.js    → client/tailwind.config.js
   client/tsconfig.json         → client/tsconfig.json
   client/tsconfig.app.json     → client/tsconfig.app.json
   client/tsconfig.node.json    → client/tsconfig.node.json
   client/postcss.config.js     → client/postcss.config.js
   client/index.html            → client/index.html
   client/src/index.css         → client/src/index.css
   .env.example                 → .env.example
   .gitignore                   → .gitignore
   ```
   ⚠️ Do NOT copy package.json files yet. They need auditing (may have unwanted dependencies).

8. **Audit and copy package.json files** — Open each, remove dependencies not in the spec's tech stack:
   - `client/package.json` — Keep: react, react-dom, @tanstack/react-query, zustand, tailwindcss, vite, typescript. Remove anything step-specific.
   - Root `package.json` — Keep: express, @supabase/supabase-js, bullmq, ioredis, dotenv, cors. Remove anything step-specific. Ensure `"type": "module"` is set (v2 uses ESM throughout — `import`/`export`, not `require()`). Add `"scripts": { "dev:server": "node server/server.js" }`.
   - Copy cleaned versions to v2.

9. **Create empty `sql/schema.sql`** — Will be populated in Phase 2.

10. **npm install** in v2 repo — both client/ and root. Verify no errors.

11. **Create minimal client/src/main.tsx** — Just enough to mount React:
    ```tsx
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
    import './index.css'

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <div className="p-8 text-lg">Content Pipeline v2 — Shell ready</div>
      </React.StrictMode>
    )
    ```

12. **Create minimal server/server.js** — Just enough to serve:
    ```javascript
    import express from 'express';
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());
    app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => res.json({ status: 'ok' }));
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
    app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on :${PORT}`));
    ```

13. **npm run dev** — Vite dev server starts, page loads with "Content Pipeline v2 — Shell ready".

14. **git init** + initial commit in both v2 repos.

### Do NOT do in Phase 0
- Copy any v1 React components, hooks, stores, or routes
- Copy any v1 server routes or services (except db.js if needed)
- Create any application logic
- These all happen in Phases 1-9 via the just-in-time audit process

### Deliverables
- [ ] content-pipeline-v2/ created with clean folder structure
- [ ] content-pipeline-modules-v2/ created with seed modules
- [ ] Seed modules present: sitemap-parser (Step 1) and url-dedup (Step 2) with manifest.json + execute.js
- [ ] Specs copied to v2/specs/
- [ ] CLAUDE.md at root of both repos
- [ ] Inert config files copied (vite, tailwind, tsconfig, postcss, index.html, index.css, .env.example, .gitignore)
- [ ] package.json files audited and cleaned
- [ ] `npm install` works (client + root)
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts Vite dev server — page loads
- [ ] Minimal Express server runs on :3001
- [ ] git init + initial commit in both repos

---

## Phase 1 — Shell UI

**Goal:** Header bar with navigation, routing between three pages, all showing placeholder content. Adapted from existing AppHeader + router.

**Spec reference:** Part 3 (UI Shell — Top-Level Structure)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Part 3. Every UI element, nav item, route, and layout decision described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `AppHeader.tsx` → compare against Part 3. Nav items need changing to [New Project, Projects, Templates].
- `router.tsx` → compare against Part 3. Routes need updating to /new, /projects, /templates.
- `App.tsx` → compare against Part 3. Existing has both router-based and tab-based rendering — should be router only.
- `Toast.tsx` → likely REUSE (standalone utility, no step-specific logic).
- `appStore.ts` → likely REUSE (toast state used by many components).
- `main.tsx` → compare against Phase 0 minimal version. May already be replaced.

### Build
1. **Header bar** — Update existing. Fixed top. Logo "OnlyiGaming Content Tool" on left. Three nav items.
2. **Routing** — Update existing router.tsx. Three routes with placeholder content. Also add `/projects/:projectId/runs/:runId` → placeholder "Run View" page (Phase 2 will redirect here after project creation, Phase 3 builds the real content).
3. **Styling** — Keep existing Tailwind setup. Dark header, light content area.

### Do NOT build
- Run View (Phase 3)
- Any data fetching
- Any Supabase connection
- Step navigation

### Deliverables
- [ ] Header renders on all pages with updated nav
- [ ] Nav items highlight active route
- [ ] All three routes work
- [ ] Templates page shows empty state
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Old tab-based navigation removed (appStore.activeTab can stay but isn't used for routing)

---

## Phase 2 — Step 0: Project Creation

**Goal:** User can create a project. Data persists in Supabase. After creation, user lands on the Run View (placeholder).

**Spec reference:** Part 4 (Step 0), Part 10 (Database Schema — projects, pipeline_runs, pipeline_stages tables)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Parts 4 and 10. Every form field, table column, API behavior, and redirect described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `Step0ProjectSetup.tsx` → compare against Part 4. Has project creation form + TanStack Query mutations. Schema fields differ in v2.
- `routes/projects.js` → compare against Part 10 + Part 16. Has CRUD routes. Schema differs.
- `api/client.ts` → compare against Part 16. Has `api.getProjects`, `api.createProject`. Types need updating.
- `services/db.js` → likely REUSE (just Supabase client init).
- `server.js` → compare against Phase 0 minimal version. Remove WebSocket/Redis pub-sub. Keep Express + CORS + JSON + static.
- `types/step.ts` → compare against Part 10 + STEP_CONFIG. Update types to match v2 schema.

### Build

1. **Database schema** — Create NEW tables in Supabase (from spec Part 10). Drop/ignore old tables.
   - `projects` (id, name, description, timing, template_id, status, created_at)
   - `pipeline_runs` (id, project_id, status, current_step, started_at, completed_at)
   - `pipeline_stages` (id, run_id, step_index, step_name, status, input_data, input_render_schema, output_data, output_render_schema, working_pool, working_pool_render_schema, started_at, completed_at)

2. **Step 0 form** — At `/new`:
   - Project Name (required)
   - Template (disabled, "Coming in v2")
   - Parent Project (optional, disabled in v1)
   - Intent (optional freeform text)
   - Timing (optional, disabled — "Not available yet". Placeholder for: one-off / scheduled / continuous)
   - [Create & Start Run] button
   - **NO Description field.** This was removed per UI_REFERENCE.md.
   - **NO Content Type field.** Old remnant — removed.

3. **Server route** — `POST /api/projects`:
   - Creates projects row
   - Creates pipeline_runs row (status: "running", current_step: 0)
   - Creates 11 pipeline_stages rows (step 0 = "active", steps 1-10 = "pending")
   - Returns project + run IDs

4. **After creation** — Redirect to `/projects/:projectId/runs/:runId`

5. **Projects list** — At `/projects`:
   - `GET /api/projects` → List all projects
   - Show name, description, status, created date
   - Click → navigate to latest run

6. **Express server** — server.js:
   - Remove WebSocket code
   - Remove Redis pub/sub subscriber
   - Keep: Express, CORS, JSON parsing, static file serving, SPA fallback
   - Port: 3001 (or keep 3000 — update Vite proxy)

### STEP_CONFIG

Define a constant for all 11 steps. This is used everywhere steps are referenced:

```typescript
const STEP_CONFIG = [
  { index: 0, name: "Project Start", description: "Define project scope and metadata" },
  { index: 1, name: "Discovery", description: "Find candidate sources and seed data" },
  { index: 2, name: "Validation", description: "Filter before committing to expensive operations" },
  { index: 3, name: "Scraping", description: "Fetch actual content from validated sources" },
  { index: 4, name: "Filtering & Assembly", description: "Clean and organize into source packages" },
  { index: 5, name: "Analysis & Generation", description: "Produce output content from sources" },
  { index: 6, name: "Quality Assurance", description: "Verify output meets standards" },
  { index: 7, name: "Routing", description: "Decide what happens to items that fail QA" },
  { index: 8, name: "Bundling", description: "Package into delivery formats" },
  { index: 9, name: "Distribution", description: "Push to external systems" },
  { index: 10, name: "Review", description: "Final human gate before publication" }
];
```

This STEP_CONFIG is copied verbatim from SKELETON_SPEC_v2.md Part 5. It is the single source of truth. Do NOT modify it.

### Do NOT build
- Step approval for Step 0 (Phase 3)
- Run View internals (Phase 3)
- Any submodule UI

### Deliverables
- [ ] Supabase tables created (projects, pipeline_runs, pipeline_stages)
- [ ] Project creation form works
- [ ] Data persists in Supabase
- [ ] Projects list shows created projects
- [ ] Click project → navigates to run view (placeholder)
- [ ] Express server running on :3001
- [ ] WebSocket code removed from server.js

---

## Phase 3 — Universal Step Template + Run View

**Goal:** When viewing a run, user sees the vertical step accordion and the active step's workspace. Expanding a step renders the universal step template with category cards (hardcoded dummy data for now).

**Spec reference:** Part 3 (Run View), Part 5 (Universal Step Template), Part 8 (Data Flow — Level 1)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Parts 3, 5, and 8. Every status badge, button, layout element, and data flow rule described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `StepContainer.tsx` → compare against Part 3 + Part 5. Has collapsible step pattern with status badges. Internals must become universal (category cards from manifests, not step-specific content).
- `pipelineStore.ts` → compare against Part 3. Has step expansion state. Must be generic (no hardcoded step references).
- `StepApprovalFooter.tsx` → compare against Part 5. Need [SKIP STEP] button added.
- `StepSummary.tsx` → compare against Part 5. Minor updates likely.
- `useUrlParams.ts` → likely REUSE. URL-based project/run routing needed for Run View.

### Build

1. **Vertical step accordion** — Keep existing layout exactly. Each step is a collapsible card showing:
   - Numbered circle with status color (green=completed, blue=active, gray=pending)
   - Step name + description
   - Status badge (completed/active/pending/skipped)
   - Expand/collapse arrow
   - Active step auto-expanded, completed steps clickable to expand read-only output
   - Pending steps collapsed + grayed out

2. **Run View** — At `/projects/:projectId/runs/:runId`:
   - Reads pipeline_stages from Supabase for this run
   - Renders step navigation from real status data
   - Below navigation: renders the active step's workspace

3. **Step 0 in Run View** — Step 0 shows project summary (name, description, intent). [APPROVE STEP] button. Clicking approve:
   - Sets step 0 status → "completed"
   - Sets step 1 status → "active"
   - Updates pipeline_runs.current_step → 1
   - Step navigation updates

4. **Universal Step Template** — For steps 1-10 (all identical structure):
   - Step header: step name, description, status badge
   - CategoryCardGrid area (empty for now — "No submodules available" message)
   - StepSummary bar (zero counts)
   - StepApprovalFooter: [APPROVE STEP] disabled (no approved submodules), [SKIP STEP] enabled

5. **API routes:**
   - `GET /api/runs/:id` — Run status, current step
   - `GET /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex` — Step data
   - `POST /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/approve` — Step approval (basic version — just status update and advance, no pool aggregation yet)
   - `POST /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/skip` — Skip step (pass-through)

6. **State management:**
   - TanStack Query for run/step data
   - `pipelineStore` (Zustand) for active step selection only

### Do NOT build
- CategoryCardGrid with real submodule data (Phase 4)
- SubmodulePanel (Phase 5)
- Working pool mechanics (Phase 7)
- File upload (Phase 6)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Run View renders with real step status data
- [ ] Step navigation shows correct status per step
- [ ] Step 0 approval advances to Step 1
- [ ] Skip step works
- [ ] Active step shows universal template
- [ ] Completed steps show read-only output (placeholder)
- [ ] Locked steps non-clickable

---

## Phase 4 — Module Auto-Discovery + Category Cards

**Goal:** Skeleton reads manifests from the modules repo and renders real category cards. No pane yet — cards are visual only.

**Spec reference:** Part 13 (Module Auto-Discovery), Part 5 (Category Cards)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Parts 13 and 5. Every card element, manifest field, status indicator, and API shape described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `CategoryCardGrid.tsx` → compare against Part 5. Has card grid with category expand/collapse and submodule rows. Needs v2 additions: data operation icon (➕➖＝), cost badge from manifest, status-based display.
- `useSubmodules.ts` → compare against Part 16. Has `useSubmoduleMetadata()` fetching from `/api/submodules`. API shape differs in v2.
- `routes/submodules.js` → compare against Part 13 + Part 16. Has module loading from filesystem + endpoint. Must change from loading .js files to reading manifest.json.

### Build

1. **Module loader service** — Server-side module loader:
   - Read `MODULES_PATH` env var (points to modules repo)
   - Scan `step-{N}-{name}/*/manifest.json`
   - Validate required fields
   - Store in-memory registry
   - (Existing code loads `.js` files — change to load `manifest.json`)

2. **Create 2-3 test manifests** in modules repo:
   - `step-1-discovery/sitemap-parser/manifest.json` (cost: cheap, category: crawling, data_operation: add)
   - `step-1-discovery/rss-feeds/manifest.json` (cost: cheap, category: news, data_operation: add)
   - `step-2-validation/url-filter/manifest.json` (cost: cheap, category: filtering, data_operation: remove)
   - NO execute.js yet — just manifests

3. **API route** — `GET /api/submodules`:
   - `GET /api/submodules?step=1` — Returns submodules for a step, grouped by category
   - Include manifest fields needed for cards

4. **CategoryCardGrid** —
   - Categories grouped from manifest `category` field
   - Each category card shows category name, submodule count
   - Click category → expands inline, shows submodule rows
   - Each submodule row: name, description, cost badge, data operation icon (➕➖＝)
   - Clicking submodule row → nothing yet (Phase 5 wires this to pane)

5. **Submodule status on cards** — All show "idle" for now (submodule_runs table created in Phase 7). Build the status display logic (idle, running, has_results, approved, failed) but hardcode to "idle" until Phase 7 wires real data.

### Do NOT build
- SubmodulePanel (Phase 5)
- execute.js files (Phase 9)
- File upload or input mechanics
- Working pool

### Deliverables
- [ ] Module loader reads manifest.json files at startup
- [ ] Invalid manifests logged and skipped
- [ ] GET /api/submodules returns manifest data grouped by category
- [ ] CategoryCardGrid renders from real manifest data
- [ ] Category expand/collapse works
- [ ] Submodule rows show name, description, cost, operation icon
- [ ] Status indicators work (all show "idle" since nothing has run)

---

## Phase 5 — Universal Pane Template

**Goal:** Clicking a submodule row opens the SubmodulePanel. Panel has three accordions (all empty/placeholder inside). CTA footer with three buttons. Panel closes properly.

**Spec reference:** Part 6 (Universal Pane Template — structure only, not internals)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Part 6 structure sections. Every accordion, CTA button, toggle, close behavior, and panel layout described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `SubmodulePanel.tsx` → compare against Part 6. Has panel with accordions, CTA footer, escape key handling, backdrop. Needs exact three accordions (Input blue, Options teal, Results pink) and CTA button logic per spec.
- `panelStore.ts` → compare against Part 6. Has panel open/close + accordion state. Likely REUSE with minor tweaks.

### Build

1. **SubmodulePanel** — Slides from LEFT side of screen:
   - Header: step name + submodule name
   - Data operation indicator (➕➖＝) with toggle
   - Three accordions: Input (blue), Options (teal), Results (pink)
   - CTA footer pinned at bottom

2. **Accordion behavior:**
   - Each accordion: colored header, expand/collapse on click
   - Only content is placeholder text for now
   - Input: "Input content will appear here"
   - Options: "Options will appear here"
   - Results: "Results will appear here"

3. **CTA Footer** — Three buttons per spec:
   - RUN TASK (pink, primary) — disabled (no input yet)
   - SEE RESULTS (gray) — disabled (no results yet)
   - APPROVE (green) — disabled (no results yet)

4. **Data operation toggle** — ➕➖＝ icons. Reads default from manifest. Click cycles through options. Saves to `run_submodule_config.data_operation`.

5. **Panel state:**
   - `panelStore` — which panel is open, which submodule
   - Click submodule row → opens panel
   - Click outside / close button → closes panel
   - Only one panel open at a time

6. **API route:**
   - `PUT /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/submodules/:submoduleId/config` — Upsert config (data_operation for now)
   - `GET /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/submodules/:submoduleId/config` — Get saved config

7. **Database table:**
   - `run_submodule_config` (from spec Part 10)

### Do NOT build
- Input accordion internals (Phase 6)
- Options accordion internals (Phase 6)
- Results accordion internals (Phase 7)
- RUN TASK execution (Phase 7)
- APPROVE flow (Phase 7)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Click submodule row → panel slides open
- [ ] Panel shows correct submodule name and step
- [ ] Three accordions expand/collapse
- [ ] CTA buttons render with correct disabled states
- [ ] Data operation toggle works and persists
- [ ] Close panel works (click outside, escape key, close button)
- [ ] run_submodule_config table created

---

## Phase 6 — Pane Internals: Input + Options

**Goal:** Input accordion handles file upload and content preview. Options accordion renders submodule options (auto-rendered from manifest). SAVE INPUT and SAVE OPTIONS work.

**Spec reference:** Part 6 (Input accordion, Options accordion), Part 9 (Shared Step Context, File Upload Flow)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Parts 6 and 9. Every upload zone element, auto-resolution rule, options rendering path, save button, and preview behavior described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `CsvUploadInput.tsx` → compare against Part 6 + Part 9. Has drag-and-drop CSV upload. Flow may differ in v2.
- `SubmoduleOptions.tsx` → compare against Part 6. Has auto-rendering of options from metadata. Must render from manifest options[] in v2.
- `ResultsList.tsx` → compare against Part 6. May be useful starting point for ContentRenderer.
- `useStepContext.ts` → compare against Part 9. Has step context fetching pattern. Schema differs in v2.

### Build

1. **Input accordion internals:**
   - Upload zone: drag-and-drop area for CSV/XLSX
   - Content preview below upload zone
   - Auto-resolution logic (spec Part 6): saved input config → previous step output → step_context → empty state
   - Source label: "From Step N", "From uploaded data", "Saved input"
   - [SAVE INPUT] button — active when input source differs from saved

2. **File upload flow** (spec Part 9):
   - `POST /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/context` — multipart upload
   - Server parses CSV/XLSX
   - Validates columns against step's union of requires_columns
   - Stores in step_context table
   - Returns entity_count, columns_found, columns_missing

3. **step_context table** (from spec Part 10)

4. **Content preview** — ContentRenderer component:
   - Reads display_type from render_schema
   - For user uploads (no render_schema): table view showing all CSV columns, requires_columns highlighted
   - For inherited data: uses source's render_schema
   - v1 display types: table, url_list, content_cards, file_list

5. **Shared context banner** — When step_context exists and submodule has no saved input:
   - Inline banner in upload zone: "Found X entities from uploaded data. [Use these] [Upload different]"
   - [Use these] → writes { source: "step_context" } to input_config
   - [Upload different] → shows upload dropzone

6. **Options accordion internals:**
   - If manifest has options_component → load custom React component (from modules repo)
   - If manifest has options[] but no options_component → auto-render form from SubmoduleOptions primitive
   - If neither → show "No options" message
   - [SAVE OPTIONS] button — active when options differ from saved
   - Dirty-state tracking (deep comparison of current vs saved)

7. **RUN TASK activation:**
   - Enable when hasInput is true (any data resolved from auto-resolution)
   - Disable when isRunning

8. **API routes:**
   - `POST /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/context` — File upload
   - `GET /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/context` — Get step context

### Do NOT build
- Results accordion internals (Phase 7)
- BullMQ job execution (Phase 7)
- APPROVE flow (Phase 7)
- Actual submodule execute.js logic (Phase 9)

### Deliverables
- [ ] step_context table created in Supabase
- [ ] CSV upload works end-to-end (upload → parse → store → preview)
- [ ] Content preview renders uploaded data
- [ ] Auto-resolution picks correct source
- [ ] Shared context banner works between submodules
- [ ] Options auto-render from manifest works
- [ ] SAVE INPUT and SAVE OPTIONS persist to run_submodule_config
- [ ] RUN TASK enables when input exists
- [ ] ContentRenderer handles table display_type

---

## Phase 7 — Execution + Results + Approval

**Goal:** RUN TASK creates a BullMQ job, worker executes submodule, results appear, user approves, working pool updates.

**Spec reference:** Part 15 (Job Queue), Part 14 (Execute Function), Part 6 (Results accordion), Part 17 (Approval Mechanics), Part 8 (Working Pool)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Parts 15, 14, 6, 17, and 8. Every queue config, worker behavior, results rendering rule, approval flow step, and pool update mechanic described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### V1 Audit (open → compare against spec → REUSE / FIX / FRESH)
- `workers/stageWorker.js` → compare against Part 14 + Part 15. Has BullMQ worker pattern, Redis connection, job processing. Execution model differs in v2.
- `routes/submodules.js` → compare against Part 16. Has execution routes, approval routes, result fetching. API shapes differ. (Already audited in Phase 4 — re-check execution-specific parts.)
- `useSubmodules.ts` → compare against Part 16. Has `useExecuteSubmodule`, `useBatchApprove`, `useApproveSubmoduleRun`. (Already audited in Phase 4 — re-check execution hooks.)

### Build

1. **BullMQ setup:**
   - Redis connection
   - One queue: `pipeline-stages`
   - stageWorker process
   - Cost-based timeout/retry/priority (spec Part 15 table)

2. **Execute route** (spec Part 16):
   - `POST /api/runs/:runId/steps/:stepIndex/submodules/:submoduleId/run`
   - Check no active run (409 if pending/running exists)
   - Resolve input from auto-resolution
   - Load options from saved config or manifest defaults
   - Create submodule_runs row (status: pending)
   - Create BullMQ job
   - Return { submodule_run_id, status: "pending" }

3. **submodule_runs table** (from spec Part 10)

4. **Worker logic** (spec Part 15):
   - Load execute.js from MODULES_PATH
   - Build tools object (logger, http, progress)
   - Call execute(input, options, tools)
   - Write results → submodule_runs.output_data
   - Copy manifest output_schema → output_render_schema
   - Update status

5. **Results accordion:**
   - Polling: GET /api/submodule-runs/:id every 2s while running
   - Progress display during execution
   - On completion: render results using ContentRenderer (pass-through from output_data + output_render_schema)
   - The skeleton does NOT add checkboxes or selection UI — ContentRenderer reads `selectable` from render_schema
   - If `selectable: true` in render_schema → ContentRenderer renders checkboxes + Select all/Deselect all
   - If `selectable: false` or absent → results are read-only, APPROVE means approve all
   - Summary line: total count (+ approved/rejected counts when selectable)
   - Per-row data operation icon only when selectable (read-only indicator)

6. **Approval flow** (spec Part 16 + Part 17):
   - APPROVE button → POST /api/submodule-runs/:id/approve
   - Request: { approved_item_keys: [...] }
   - Server: store approved_items, update status, update working pool, log decision
   - Working pool update logic (spec Part 8): read data_operation, apply ➕➖＝ per entity
   - Concurrency protection: SELECT FOR UPDATE on pipeline_stages row
   - Panel closes, card updates

7. **Re-approval flow:**
   - Reopen approved submodule → see previous results via ContentRenderer
   - If `selectable: true`: checkboxes reflect previous approval states, user can modify and re-approve
   - If `selectable: false`: results shown read-only, user can [Try again] to re-run

8. **decision_log table** (from spec Part 10)

9. **GET submodule-runs response** (spec Part 16):
   - Full response shape with status, progress, output_data, approved_items, render_schema

10. **Panel close during execution:**
    - Job continues in background
    - CategoryCardGrid row shows spinner
    - Toast on completion/failure
    - Reopen → resume polling if still running

### Do NOT build
- Real submodule execute.js logic (Phase 9)
- Step-to-step data flow (Phase 8)

### Test with
- Create a simple test execute.js in modules repo that returns dummy data after a 3-second delay. Validates the full flow without real scraping logic.

### Deliverables
- [ ] submodule_runs table created in Supabase
- [ ] decision_log table created in Supabase
- [ ] RUN TASK → BullMQ job → worker executes → results appear
- [ ] Progress updates during execution
- [ ] Results render via ContentRenderer (pass-through from output_render_schema)
- [ ] Selectable mode works when render_schema declares selectable: true
- [ ] Non-selectable mode: APPROVE sends all item keys
- [ ] APPROVE updates working pool
- [ ] Re-approval works
- [ ] Decision log entries created
- [ ] Polling handles panel close/reopen
- [ ] Toast notifications on completion
- [ ] CategoryCardGrid reflects submodule status

---

## Phase 7b — Pane Completeness

**Goal:** Fill all gaps in the SubmodulePanel. The three accordions must be fully functional before step-to-step plumbing.

**Spec reference:** Part 6 (Universal Pane Template — Upload Zone, SAVE INPUT, SAVE OPTIONS, NEXT, Results action CTAs), UI_REFERENCE.md sections 6e/6f/6g

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Part 6 and UI_REFERENCE 6e/6f/6g. Every textarea, divider, button, CTA, toggle, and guided flow behavior described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### Build

1. **UrlTextarea primitive** (`components/primitives/UrlTextarea`):
   - Multiline textarea with label "Paste URLs or data"
   - Parses input: one URL/entity per line
   - Returns structured data to Input accordion
   - Typing in textarea clears any uploaded CSV (mutual exclusion)

2. **Input accordion layout update** (matches mockup):
   - UrlTextarea (top)
   - "or" divider
   - CsvUploadInput (below divider) — already built
   - ↓ Download template link (generates CSV from manifest `requires_columns`)
   - Content preview via ContentRenderer — already built
   - [SAVE INPUT] button at bottom

3. **SAVE INPUT button:**
   - Active when user has changed input (CSV uploaded OR textarea has content)
   - Label: "Save Input (no changes)" when clean, "Save Input" when dirty
   - Saves to `run_submodule_config.input_config`
   - **Guided flow:** After save → collapses Input, opens Options automatically

4. **SAVE OPTIONS button:**
   - Active when options have been modified from saved/default state
   - Label: "Save Options (no changes)" when clean, "Save Options" when dirty
   - Saves to `run_submodule_config.options`

5. **NEXT button** (Options accordion, below SAVE OPTIONS):
   - Active when `hasInput` is true
   - If options are dirty, saves them first
   - Then: collapses Options, opens Results, triggers RUN TASK automatically
   - Completes guided flow: Input → Save → Options → Next → Run

6. **Results action CTAs** (inside Results accordion, below result content):
   - [Change Input] → collapses Results, opens Input accordion
   - [Change Options] → collapses Results, opens Options accordion
   - [Download] → exports current results
   - [Try again] → clears results display, resets to fresh state for re-run

7. **CategoryCardGrid ➕➖＝ toggle:**
   - Each submodule row shows data operation icon (➕➖＝), clickable, cycles through add/remove/transform
   - Syncs with the read-only indicator in the pane — toggling in either location updates both
   - Saves to `run_submodule_config.data_operation`

### Do NOT build
- Anything from Phase 8 (step-to-step data flow)
- New display_types for ContentRenderer
- Options component loading (manifest `options_component`) — deferred

### Deliverables
- [ ] UrlTextarea primitive exists and works
- [ ] Input accordion shows textarea + "or" + CSV upload + template link
- [ ] Mutual exclusion: textarea clears CSV, CSV clears textarea
- [ ] SAVE INPUT button with dirty tracking and guided flow
- [ ] SAVE OPTIONS button with dirty tracking
- [ ] NEXT button triggers save + run
- [ ] [Change Input], [Change Options], [Download], [Try again] in Results
- [ ] CategoryCardGrid rows show ➕➖＝ toggle, syncs with pane indicator
- [ ] Full guided flow: open pane → enter data → save → options → next → running

---

## Phase 8 — Step-to-Step Plumbing

**Goal:** Full pipeline flow works. Approve step → aggregates pool → writes output → activates next step → next step reads input. Data flows from Step 1 through Step 2 with real rendering.

**Spec reference:** Part 8 (Data Flow — all three levels), Part 16 (Step Approval server logic)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read Parts 8 and 16. Every data aggregation rule, pool merge mechanic, skip behavior, and approval validation described in the spec must be present. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### Build

1. **Step approval — full version** (spec Part 16):
   - Validate at least one approved submodule_run
   - Only latest approved run per submodule contributes
   - Copy working_pool → output_data
   - Copy output_render_schema → next step's input_render_schema
   - Initialize next step's working_pool from input_data
   - Mark step completed, next step active
   - Update pipeline_runs.current_step
   - Log decision

2. **Next step input rendering:**
   - Step 2 opens → Input accordion shows "From Step 1 · X entities"
   - ContentRenderer uses input_render_schema from previous step
   - Submodules in Step 2 auto-resolve input from step output

3. **Skip step** — Pass input_data → output_data unchanged

4. **Completed step view** — Click completed step in navigation → read-only view of output_data

5. **Run completion** — After Step 10 approval, mark run as "completed"

### Deliverables
- [ ] Approve Step 1 → Step 2 activates with Step 1's output
- [ ] Step 2 submodules see Step 1 data as input
- [ ] Skip step passes data through
- [ ] Completed steps show output read-only
- [ ] Run completes after Step 10
- [ ] Full flow: create project → step 0 → step 1 (run submodule, approve) → step 2 receives data

---

## Phase 8b — Code Review Fixes (Pre-Phase 9 Gate)

**Goal:** Fix all critical and medium issues identified in Gemini code review (Feb 15, 2026) before running end-to-end tests. Phase 9 must NOT start until all items below are resolved.

**Context:** Two-pass Gemini review of full codebase against all 6 specs. All findings tracked in BACKLOG.md (R001–R009, K003).

### CRITICAL — Must fix first (Phase 9 will hit these)

#### R001: handleNext race condition
- **File:** `client/src/components/shared/SubmodulePanel.tsx` lines 400–405
- **Problem:** `onSaveConfig()` fires (async mutation), then `handleRunTask()` starts immediately without awaiting. The BullMQ worker reads options from DB — if save hasn't committed yet, worker executes with stale/missing options.
- **Fix:** Refactor so `handleNext` awaits the save mutation completing before calling `handleRunTask`. Either pass `mutateAsync` from the parent or restructure the save+run flow to be sequential.
- **Verify:** In the browser, set options → click NEXT → confirm worker log shows the new options (not defaults).

#### R002: Orphaned pending row on enqueue failure
- **File:** `server/routes/submoduleRuns.js` lines 170–199
- **Problem:** `submodule_runs` row is inserted with `status: 'pending'` BEFORE `enqueueSubmoduleJob()`. If Redis is down or BullMQ fails, the row stays `pending` forever. The active-run check at line 46 then blocks all future runs for that submodule.
- **Fix:** Wrap the enqueue call in try/catch. On failure, either delete the `submodule_runs` row or update its status to `'failed'` with an error message. Then re-throw so the API returns 500.
- **Verify:** Stop Redis → trigger a run → confirm error response AND no stuck `pending` row in DB.

### MEDIUM — Fix after CRITICALs

#### R003: No global ErrorBoundary
- **File:** `client/src/main.tsx`
- **Problem:** No ErrorBoundary wraps the app. Any component render error = white screen crash. During Phase 9 testing with real data, unexpected null values will cause crashes.
- **Fix:** Install `react-error-boundary`. Wrap `<RouterProvider>` in `<ErrorBoundary>` with a fallback UI showing the error message and a "Reload" button.
- **Verify:** Temporarily throw an error in any component → confirm fallback UI appears instead of white screen.

#### R004: Imprecise query invalidation
- **File:** `client/src/hooks/useSubmoduleRuns.ts` line 64
- **Problem:** `useApproveSubmoduleRun` invalidates `['latestSubmoduleRuns']` without scoping to the current run/step. This fuzzy-matches and refetches ALL cached queries starting with that key — causes stale data bugs as the app scales.
- **Fix:** Scope invalidation to the current run and step: `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['latestSubmoduleRuns', runId, stepIndex] })`. Pass `runId` and `stepIndex` to the mutation via `onSuccess` context or hook params.
- **Verify:** Approve a submodule run in Step 1 → confirm that Step 2's cached data is NOT refetched (check Network tab).

#### K003: No transaction on step approval
- **File:** `server/routes/runs.js` lines 146–185
- **Problem:** Step approval performs 3 sequential DB writes (complete current step, activate next step, update run pointer) without a transaction. A double-click, slow request, or partial failure leaves corrupted pipeline state.
- **Fix:** Wrap the 3 writes in a Supabase RPC function that uses a Postgres transaction, or at minimum use a Postgres function with `BEGIN ... COMMIT`. If Supabase JS client doesn't support transactions, create a `approve_step(stage_id, ...)` Postgres function and call it via `.rpc()`.
- **Verify:** Add a deliberate error before the 3rd write → confirm the first 2 writes are rolled back (current step NOT marked completed).

#### R008: Synchronous CSV parsing blocks event loop
- **File:** `server/routes/stepContext.js` line 3
- **Problem:** Uses `csv-parse/sync` which blocks the Node.js event loop. A 10MB CSV upload freezes the server for all requests until parsing completes. The pipeline needs to handle large CSVs (hundreds/thousands of companies).
- **Fix:** Switch from `import { parse } from 'csv-parse/sync'` to the async callback or stream-based API from `csv-parse`. Parse inside a Promise wrapper or use `csv-parse`'s callback form.
- **Verify:** Upload a CSV with 5,000+ rows → confirm server remains responsive (hit another endpoint during upload).

#### R009: Shared import path outside src/
- **File:** `client/src/config/stepConfig.ts` line 1
- **Problem:** Imports `../../../shared/stepConfig.js` which reaches outside the `client/src/` directory. Works today because Vite is lenient, but breaks if path aliases are added, build tool changes, or folder restructuring occurs.
- **Fix:** Either (a) add a Vite alias in `vite.config.ts`: `resolve: { alias: { '@shared': path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared') } }` and import as `@shared/stepConfig`, or (b) copy `shared/stepConfig.js` into `client/src/config/` and import locally (acceptable since it's a small constants file).
- **Verify:** Run `npm run build` in client/ → confirm clean build with no warnings about paths outside src/.

### Deliverables checklist

- [x] R001: handleNext awaits save before running
- [x] R002: Enqueue failure cleans up pending row
- [x] R003: Global ErrorBoundary installed and working
- [x] R004: Query invalidation scoped to `[runId, stepIndex]`
- [x] K003: Step approval wrapped in transaction (Postgres function or RPC)
- [x] R008: CSV parsing switched to async
- [x] R009: Shared import resolved via alias or local copy
- [x] All items verified with the steps described above

---

## Phase 9 — First Real Submodules

**Goal:** Build 2-3 real submodules in the modules repo to validate the full architecture.

**Spec reference:** SUBMODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md (full document)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, re-read SUBMODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md. Every manifest field, execute() signature, return format, and tools usage described in the guide must be correctly implemented. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

This is when work shifts to the modules repo. The skeleton should not change (if it does, that's a spec gap — document it).

### Build (in modules repo)

1. **Step 1 — Sitemap Parser** (add, cheap) — Already has working execute.js from seed modules. Verify it works end-to-end with real skeleton. Fix if needed, don't rewrite.

2. **Step 1 — RSS Feeds** (add, cheap) — NEW execute.js:
   - Takes entities with website field
   - Tries common feed paths
   - Returns table display_type

3. **Step 2 — URL Dedup** (remove, cheap) — Already has working execute.js from seed modules. Verify it works end-to-end. Fix if needed.

4. **Step 2 — URL Filter** (remove, cheap) — NEW execute.js:
   - Takes URLs from Step 1
   - Filters by pattern/status code
   - Returns filtered subset

### Validates
- manifest auto-discovery works with real manifests
- execute.js receives correct input/options/tools
- Results render correctly per display_type
- ➕ submodules accumulate in pool
- ➖ submodule filters pool
- Entity scoping works
- Step 1 → Step 2 data handoff works

### Deliverables
- [ ] All submodules appear in UI automatically
- [ ] Full flow: upload companies → discover URLs → filter URLs → approve both steps
- [ ] Entity scoping preserved throughout

---

## Phase 10 — Polish and Edge Cases

**Goal:** Handle all the edge cases from the spec that weren't covered in core phases.

**Spec reference:** Part 11 (Error Handling), Part 12 (Loading States), Part 6 (all remaining details), Part 5 (all remaining details)

**⚠️ CROSS-CHECK:** After building, do a FULL re-read of the entire SKELETON_SPEC_v2.md. Every behavior, edge case, and UI detail that was not built in Phases 0-9 must be built here. The deliverables are a checklist — the spec is the contract.

### Build
- Template system placeholder (table exists, UI shows empty state)
- Error states: failed jobs, network errors, validation failures
- Loading states: skeletons, spinners, disabled buttons
- Responsive layout adjustments
- Bulk filter-and-approve in results (TanStack Table column filtering)
- CSV template download per step
- Decision log viewing (read-only list of all decisions for a run)

---

## Appendix: What NOT To Build

These are explicitly out of scope for the skeleton build:

- Content Library tables (Step 10 module concern)
- AI provider integration (tools.ai — future)
- Cache system (tools.cache — future)
- SSE/WebSocket (v2 — polling is fine for v1)
- Template creation UI (v2)
- Monitoring/alerting
- CI/CD pipeline
- User authentication (single-user tool in v1)
