# OnlyiGaming SEO Implementation Project

## Project Overview
This is an SEO optimization initiative for OnlyiGaming, a B2B directory platform serving the iGaming industry with 1,500+ company profiles across 81 categories. The strategy focuses on becoming the definitive knowledge layer through structural clarity rather than volume-based content creation.

1. Deploy foundational SEO infrastructure: schema markup, optimized title/meta templates, semantic heading structure
2. Establish authoritative knowledge base with comprehensive FAQ content across all 81 directory categories
3. Maximize SERP visibility through rich snippets, FAQ dropdowns, and Google Jobs integration
4. Build topical authority by strategically distributing podcast/media content to strengthen directory pages
5. Deliver measurable performance: 20-30% CTR increase from rich snippets, 50-100% traffic increase to career section
