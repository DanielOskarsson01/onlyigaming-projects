## Introduction

White label casinos let you launch a branded online casino without building technology or obtaining your own license. This FAQ covers realistic costs, white label vs. turnkey trade-offs, provider selection, and the metrics that actually matter for profitability.

## What is a white label casino?

A white label casino is a fully managed online gambling platform provided by a third-party company that holds a valid gambling license, allowing you to launch under your own brand without building technology or obtaining your own license. You get a ready-to-launch casino with games, payments, and compliance—you add your logo and start marketing.

The provider handles the complex infrastructure: player account management (PAM), game integrations (typically 5,000-15,000+ titles), payment processing, KYC/AML compliance, and ongoing technical support. You operate under their gambling license through a sub-licensing arrangement, which means you can launch in weeks instead of the 12-18 months a custom build would require.

Key components included in white label solutions:

1. Pre-built casino platform with player account management
2. Gambling license (typically Curacao, sometimes MGA or Gibraltar)
3. Integrated game library from major providers
4. Payment processing and cashier system
5. 24/7 technical support and compliance management
6. Bonus engine and promotional tools

Here's the trade-off most providers won't emphasize: you're renting, not owning. The platform, the license, even your player data ultimately belongs to the provider. This makes white label ideal for testing markets and learning the business, but creates strategic limitations for long-term growth.

## How much does a white label casino cost?

White label casino costs typically range from €15,000-€60,000 for initial setup, plus monthly fees of €5,000-€15,000 and a revenue share of 10-30% of Net Gaming Revenue (NGR). But here's what providers don't highlight: total first-year cost including marketing realistically runs €150,000-€400,000.

#### Cost breakdown (2026)

1. **Setup Fee:** €15,000-€60,000. One-time, varies by customization level
2. **Monthly Platform Fee:** €5,000-€15,000. Includes hosting, support, updates
3. **Revenue Share:** 10-30% of NGR. The main ongoing cost that scales with success
4. **Payment Processing:** 3-5% of deposits. Plus gateway setup fees
5. **Marketing Budget:** €50,000-€150,000+. The real cost nobody mentions upfront
6. **Localization:** €5,000-€20,000. Per language/market you target

#### The math nobody does upfront

A 20% revenue share seems reasonable when you're projecting €50,000 monthly NGR (€10,000/month to the provider). But if you're successful and hit €300,000 NGR, you're paying €60,000/month, or €720,000/year, just in revenue share. At that point, a turnkey solution with your own license would cost less.

*Prices based on 2026 market data. Always request total cost projections at multiple revenue levels.*

### What are the hidden costs of a white label casino?

The advertised setup fee is typically 20-30% of your real first-year cost. Budget for €150,000-€400,000 total, not the €30,000 in the sales deck.

#### Commonly overlooked costs

1. **PSP setup & integration:** €2,000-€10,000 per PSP. Not included in "platform" price
2. **Rolling reserve:** 5-10% held for 6 months. Cash flow impact, not a "fee"
3. **Minimum monthly fee:** €3,000-€8,000. Kicks in during slow months
4. **Premium game providers:** €500-€2,000/month each. Top studios cost extra
5. **Additional languages:** €3,000-€8,000 per language. "Multi-language" has limits
6. **Marketing tools:** €500-€2,000/month. CRM, email, push notifications often extra

#### How to protect yourself

1. Request a complete fee schedule including all "optional" services
2. Ask: "What's my total monthly cost at €50k, €100k, and €200k NGR?"
3. Get payment processing rates in writing before signing

## What is the difference between white label and turnkey casino?

The fundamental difference is ownership: with white label, you're renting everything (platform, license, infrastructure) and paying ongoing revenue share. With turnkey, you own your license and platform, keeping 90-100% of profits after fixed fees. The right choice depends on your capital, experience, and timeline.

#### White label characteristics

1. License: Provider's (sub-license arrangement)
2. Setup cost: €15,000-€60,000
3. Monthly fees: €5,000-€15,000 plus 10-30% revenue share
4. Time to launch: 4-8 weeks
5. Customization: Limited to templates and branding
6. Data ownership: Provider controls backend

#### Turnkey characteristics

1. License: Your own (you apply and hold it)
2. Setup cost: €80,000-€200,000+
3. Monthly fees: €10,000-€25,000, minimal or no revenue share
4. Time to launch: 3-6 months
5. Customization: Full control over everything
6. Data ownership: You own everything

#### The inflection point

White label usually wins below €100,000 monthly NGR. Above €200,000 NGR, turnkey typically becomes more economical. Between those figures, it depends on your growth trajectory.

#### Choose white label if

You're new to iGaming, testing a market, have limited capital, or want to validate before major investment.

#### Choose turnkey if

You have industry experience, capital for a proper launch, plan long-term, or need regulated markets requiring your own license.

### When should I upgrade from white label to turnkey?

Consider upgrading when revenue share exceeds €30,000-€50,000/month consistently, you need access to regulated markets, or you're hitting platform limitations. Most successful operators make this transition at 18-36 months.

#### Clear signals it's time

1. **Financial:** Revenue share payments exceed €40,000/month (€480k/year). You could fund a turnkey setup from 12 months of saved revenue share.
2. **Operational:** You need features the platform won't build, or market expansion requires licenses your provider doesn't have.
3. **Strategic:** Building a sellable asset (white labels are harder to sell), establishing credibility for B2B partnerships.

#### Don't upgrade too early

The complexity and capital requirements of turnkey only make sense at scale. Below €100,000 monthly NGR, white label's simplicity usually outweighs its costs.

## How long does it take to launch a white label casino?

Providers promise 4-8 weeks, and that's technically possible—but plan for 8-12 weeks in reality. The platform setup is fast; it's everything else that takes longer than expected.

#### What the timeline actually looks like

1. **Contract & Onboarding:** Provider promises 3-5 days, reality is 1-2 weeks due to legal review and payment terms negotiation
2. **Platform Configuration:** Provider promises 1-2 weeks, reality is 2-3 weeks due to decision paralysis on game selection
3. **Branding & Design:** Provider promises 1-2 weeks, reality is 2-4 weeks due to design revisions
4. **Payment Integration:** Provider promises 1-2 weeks, reality is 3-6 weeks due to PSP onboarding and KYC requirements
5. **Testing & QA:** Provider promises 1 week, reality is 2-3 weeks for bug fixes and user acceptance testing
6. **Compliance Review:** Provider promises 3-5 days, reality is 1-2 weeks due to documentation gaps

#### The biggest time sink

Payment provider onboarding. PSPs have their own KYC requirements, and getting approved can take 4-6 weeks by itself. Start this process immediately. Don't wait for the platform to be ready.

#### Speed tips

1. Have all business documentation ready before signing
2. Pre-select your game providers and payment methods
3. Prepare branding assets in advance
4. Accept more default configurations; customize later

### Do I need my own gambling license for a white label casino?

No—operating under the provider's license is the whole point of white label. You function as a sub-licensee under their master license, which eliminates the 6-12 month licensing process and €50,000-€300,000+ in licensing costs.

#### How sub-licensing works

1. Provider holds licenses in jurisdictions like Curacao, Malta (MGA), or Gibraltar
2. You operate under their umbrella as a sub-brand
3. Provider handles regulatory compliance and reporting
4. You focus on marketing and player acquisition

#### The downsides nobody emphasizes

- **Market restrictions:** Curacao doesn't cover UK, Germany, Sweden, Ontario, or US states
- **Shared risk:** Provider's compliance issues affect all their white labels
- **Exit trap:** Switching providers means potentially losing your player database

## What are the risks and downsides of a white label casino?

White label's advantages (speed, simplicity, lower upfront cost) come with real trade-offs that providers understandably don't emphasize.

#### Genuine disadvantages

1. **Revenue share erodes margins at scale:** What looks like a reasonable 15-20% at low volume becomes crippling at scale. Successful operators often pay €500,000-€1,000,000+ annually in revenue share, money that would cover a turnkey setup and your own license.

2. **Limited differentiation:** You're running on the same platform as dozens of other casinos. Same bonus engine, same back-office, often similar game selection. Competing on brand alone is difficult when the underlying product is identical.

3. **Restricted market access:** Curacao-licensed white labels can't serve UK, German, Swedish, or US players legally. If these markets are your target, white label isn't an option regardless of other factors.

4. **You don't control your destiny:** Provider goes bankrupt? You're offline. Provider loses license? You're offline. Provider gets acquired and changes terms? You negotiate from weakness.

5. **Exit is painful:** Switching providers typically means losing your player database and starting fresh. This gives your current provider enormous leverage.

Despite these drawbacks, white label remains the right choice for first-time operators, market testing, and budget-constrained launches. Just understand what you're trading for speed and simplicity.

### What are red flags when choosing a white label provider?

The biggest warning signs are non-transparent pricing, pressure to sign quickly, and unwillingness to provide reference clients. These typically indicate either inexperience or something to hide.

#### Red flags to watch for

1. **Won't share complete pricing upfront:** Legitimate providers have standardized pricing they can share immediately. "It depends" without specifics means hidden fees.
2. **No verifiable references:** Any established provider should connect you with 2-3 current operators. "Confidentiality" is usually an excuse.
3. **Pressure tactics:** "This rate expires Friday" is a sales technique, not a business reality.
4. **Vague SLA terms:** "99.9% uptime guaranteed" means nothing without penalty clauses.
5. **Unclear data ownership:** Ask explicitly: "If I leave, what happens to my player database?"
6. **No demo environment:** You should test the actual back-office before committing.

#### Due diligence essentials

Request three reference clients, test the platform for at least a week, have a lawyer review exit terms.

### What mistakes do operators make with white label casinos?

The most expensive mistake is optimizing for setup cost rather than total cost of ownership. The "cheapest" provider often becomes the most expensive within 18 months.

#### Common mistakes

1. **Choosing based on setup fee alone:** A €15,000 setup with 25% revenue share costs more than €50,000 setup with 12% once you're generating €80,000+ monthly NGR.

2. **Underestimating marketing budget:** Providers sell the platform, not player acquisition. New operators routinely budget €30,000 and need €150,000.

3. **Ignoring exit terms:** Contracts often require 6-12 months notice and may not allow you to take player data.

4. **Launching without affiliate relationships:** Affiliates drive 30-50% of traffic for most casinos. Starting without partnerships means slow, expensive growth.

#### How to avoid these

Create a detailed 12-month operational plan including marketing, support, and operations costs before signing anything.

## Who are the top white label casino providers in 2026?

The leading providers are SOFTSWISS, EveryMatrix, SoftGamings, Slotegrator, and NuxGame, but "best" depends entirely on your target market, budget, and requirements.

#### Provider overview

1. **SOFTSWISS:** Best for crypto and EU markets. Strengths: 30,000+ games, crypto-native platform. Limitations: Higher pricing tier, sometimes has waitlist. Price range: €30k-€80k setup.
2. **EveryMatrix:** Best for regulated markets and scale. Strengths: Largest aggregator, enterprise-grade platform. Limitations: Premium pricing, complex for beginners. Price range: €50k-€150k setup.
3. **SoftGamings:** Best for emerging markets. Strengths: 100+ payment methods, fast setup. Limitations: Less polished than tier-1 competitors. Price range: €15k-€50k setup.
4. **Slotegrator:** Best for budget-conscious operators. Strengths: Cost-effective, good support. Limitations: Fewer premium game providers. Price range: €12k-€40k setup.
5. **NuxGame:** Best for casino plus sports. Strengths: All-in-one solution, sportsbook included. Limitations: Less established than older providers. Price range: €20k-€60k setup.

#### What comparisons don't show

All claim 99.9% uptime but few have meaningful SLA penalties. "24/7 support" quality varies enormously. Integration timelines are almost always longer than quoted.

#### How to actually choose

1. Define your primary market first—this eliminates many options
2. Request demos and spend time in the back-office
3. Talk to 3+ current clients, not just provided references
4. Calculate 3-year total cost at different revenue scenarios

### What about white label casinos for crypto?

Crypto-focused white labels have become a distinct sub-market with different providers, faster launches, and specific trade-offs. If you're targeting crypto players specifically, standard white label providers may not be optimal.

#### Crypto-specific advantages

1. Faster KYC (often just email verification)
2. Lower payment processing costs (no PSP fees)
3. Access to markets restricting fiat gambling
4. Faster withdrawals (no banking delays)

#### Reality check

- Crypto player acquisition is intensely competitive
- Token/NFT gimmicks rarely drive sustainable traffic
- Volatility affects revenue (deposits in BTC, pay providers in EUR)
- Regulatory scrutiny is increasing

#### Specialized providers

SOFTSWISS (handles 50%+ of crypto casino volume), SoftGamings (strong crypto support, more affordable). Most successful "crypto casinos" actually accept both crypto and fiat.

### How is the white label casino market changing in 2026?

The white label market is consolidating around fewer, larger providers while regulatory pressure increases. New operators face a more professional but less forgiving landscape.

#### Key trends

1. **Revenue share rates are increasing:** 20-25% is now standard; 15% is rare. Market consolidation has pushed rates up, not down.

2. **Compliance requirements are tightening:** Even Curacao-licensed operations face more KYC/AML requirements. The "launch fast, worry later" era is ending.

3. **Mobile-first is now mobile-only:** 75%+ of casino traffic is mobile. Providers without excellent mobile experiences are struggling.

4. **Crypto is standard, not special:** Every major provider now supports crypto. It's no longer a differentiator.

5. **Market saturation in easy jurisdictions:** Curacao-licensed casinos targeting LatAm and CIS are extremely competitive.

#### What this means for new operators

Higher barriers to entry, more professional operations required from day one, marketing costs continuing to rise.

### How do I know if my white label casino is performing well?

Track conversion rates, player value, and retention, not just deposits. Most operators focus on vanity metrics while the numbers that actually matter deteriorate.

#### Key metrics to monitor

1. **Registration-to-deposit rate:** Healthy range 25-40%, warning sign below 20%, check weekly
2. **First deposit value:** Healthy range €50-€150, warning sign below €30, check weekly
3. **Player lifetime value:** Healthy range €200-€500, warning sign below €150, check monthly
4. **Cost per acquisition:** Healthy range €80-€200, warning sign above €250, check monthly
5. **NGR margin:** Healthy range 3-6% of turnover, warning sign below 2%, check monthly

#### The metrics that actually matter

- **LTV:CPA ratio:** Should be 3:1 or better. If you're spending €150 to acquire players worth €150, you're not building a business.
- **Redeposit rate:** Below 30% suggests retention problems.
- **Bonus cost as % of NGR:** Above 30% means unsustainable bonus strategy.

#### When to worry

CPA rising while LTV stays flat, declining redeposit rates over 3+ months, support ticket volume growing faster than player base.
