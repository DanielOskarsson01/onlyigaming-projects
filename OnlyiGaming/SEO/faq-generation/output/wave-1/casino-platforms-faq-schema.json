        "text": "A casino platform is specialized software infrastructure that provides the technical foundation for running online slots, live dealer games, and table games. It handles player account management (PAM), payment processing, game content integration from multiple studios, and the operational back-office tools needed to run a competitive online casino. Key components include player account management with wallet and KYC functionality, game integration hub connecting to multiple studios via API, bonus engine, payment processing, real-time reporting, and responsible gaming tools."

        "text": "Casino platform costs range from €10,000-€100,000+ for setup, plus €2,000-€50,000 monthly, depending on whether you're licensing software, using white-label, or building custom. Total first-year investment including licensing, payments, and marketing realistically runs €200,000-€1,500,000. Costs include platform setup fee (€10,000-€150,000), monthly platform fee (€2,000-€50,000), revenue share (10-30% of NGR for white-label), licensing costs (€48,000-€300,000+), payment processing (3-5% of deposits), and game provider fees (€500-€5,000/month per premium studio)."

        "text": "The advertised platform fee is typically 30-50% of your real first-year cost. Budget for €200,000-€500,000 total. Hidden costs include: game provider integration fees (€2,000-€10,000 per studio), PSP setup and rolling reserves (€5,000-€15,000 locked up), compliance and auditing (€10,000-€40,000/year), localization per market (€3,000-€8,000 per language), marketing tools and CRM (€500-€2,000/month), and dedicated support tiers (€2,000-€5,000/month)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The fundamental difference is scope: a casino platform is specialized for casino verticals only (slots, table games, live dealer), while an iGaming platform is broader infrastructure supporting multiple verticals including sportsbook, lottery, poker, and casino within a single system. Choose a casino platform if you're focused exclusively on casino and want faster time-to-market. Choose an iGaming platform if you plan to offer sportsbook alongside casino or are building a multi-product brand."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Consider upgrading when revenue share exceeds €30,000-€40,000/month consistently, you need features your white-label provider won't build, or you're hitting game integration limitations. Most successful operators make this transition at 18-30 months. Don't upgrade too early—below €80,000 monthly NGR, white-label's simplicity usually outweighs its costs."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Providers promise 4-12 weeks depending on the delivery model, but plan for 8-20 weeks in reality. The timeline includes: platform selection and contract (2-4 weeks), platform configuration (3-6 weeks), game provider integrations (4-8 weeks), payment provider setup (4-8 weeks), licensing if required (Curacao 6-8 weeks, Malta 3-6 months), and testing (2-4 weeks). The biggest time sink is payment provider onboarding."
