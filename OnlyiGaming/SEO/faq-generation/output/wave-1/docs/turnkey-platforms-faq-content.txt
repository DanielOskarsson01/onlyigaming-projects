## Introduction

Turnkey casino platforms give you full ownership of your license, platform, and player data. This FAQ covers realistic costs, when turnkey beats white label economically, licensing requirements, and the operational complexity you'll inherit.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## What is a turnkey casino platform?

A turnkey casino platform is a complete, ready-to-launch online gambling solution that includes games, payments, back-office tools, and technical infrastructure—but requires you to obtain and hold your own gambling license. Unlike white label solutions where you operate under someone else's license, turnkey gives you full ownership and control of your operation.

The provider delivers the technology stack: player account management (PAM), game integrations, payment gateway connections, CRM tools, bonus engines, and reporting dashboards. You bring the license, the brand, and the operational team. This model is designed for experienced operators who want long-term independence rather than the quick-start convenience of white label.

Key components of turnkey platforms:

1. Complete casino/sportsbook software with full source code access (often)
2. Game aggregation with 5,000-30,000+ titles from multiple providers
3. Payment processing infrastructure with multi-PSP support
4. Back-office tools for player management, compliance, and reporting
5. CRM and bonus management systems
6. API integrations for adding additional providers and services

The fundamental trade-off: turnkey requires more capital, more time, and more expertise upfront—but you own everything. Your player database, your contracts with game providers, your regulatory relationship. If you build something valuable, you can sell it as a complete business asset.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## How much does a turnkey casino platform cost?

Turnkey casino platforms typically cost €50,000-€150,000+ for setup, plus €10,000-€25,000 monthly for ongoing fees, with minimal or no revenue share (often 0-5%). But here's what the sales pitch doesn't include: licensing costs add €80,000-€300,000+, and total first-year investment realistically runs €200,000-€500,000 for a serious operation.

#### Cost breakdown (2026)

1. **Platform setup fee:** €50,000-€150,000. One-time, includes configuration and integrations
2. **Monthly platform fee:** €10,000-€25,000. Hosting, support, updates, maintenance
3. **Revenue share:** 0-5% of NGR. Much lower than white label's 15-30%
4. **Gambling license:** €80,000-€300,000+. Curacao €80k, Malta €180k+, plus annual renewals €45k-€70k
5. **Compliance & auditing:** €10,000-€40,000/year. Regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction
6. **Marketing budget:** €100,000-€300,000+. Higher than white label because you're building from scratch

#### The real math

At €200,000 monthly NGR, a white label paying 20% revenue share costs €40,000/month (€480k/year) just in revenue share. A turnkey with 3% share costs €6,000/month. The €150,000 difference in setup costs pays for itself in under 4 months at this volume.

*Prices based on 2026 market data. Turnkey economics favor operators expecting to scale beyond €150,000 monthly NGR within 18-24 months.*

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What are the hidden costs of a turnkey platform?

The platform setup fee is often 30-40% of your real first-year investment. Budget for €300,000-€500,000 total, not the €100,000 in the proposal.

#### Commonly overlooked costs

1. **License acquisition:** €80,000-€180,000+. Not included in "turnkey" price, varies dramatically by jurisdiction
2. **License annual renewal:** €45,000-€70,000/year. Ongoing regulatory cost
3. **Legal and compliance team:** €5,000-€15,000/month. You need dedicated compliance resources
4. **Technical team:** €10,000-€30,000/month. Integration maintenance, updates, troubleshooting
5. **Security infrastructure:** €10,000-€30,000 setup plus €1,000-€3,000/month. Required for compliance
6. **QA and testing cycles:** €5,000-€20,000. Often underestimated, delays cost money

#### Budget planning failures

Most operators prepare for "development" but underestimate integration processes: QA cycles, reporting fixes, maintenance. The most expensive period is when spending continues but revenue can't start yet.

#### How to protect yourself

1. Get a complete cost projection including licensing, legal, and 12 months of operations
2. Add 30% contingency for delays and unexpected requirements
3. Verify what "support" actually includes in the monthly fee

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## What is the difference between turnkey and white label casino?

The fundamental difference is ownership and control: with turnkey, you own your license, your platform, your player data, and your business. With white label, you're renting everything from the provider. Turnkey costs more upfront but builds equity; white label is faster but you're building on someone else's foundation.

#### Turnkey characteristics

1. License: Your own (you apply, qualify, and hold it)
2. Setup cost: €50,000-€150,000 plus license €80,000-€300,000+
3. Monthly fees: €10,000-€25,000 with 0-5% revenue share
4. Time to launch: 2-6 months (including licensing)
5. Customization: Full control, often source code access
6. Exit value: Full business asset, sellable

#### White label characteristics

1. License: Provider's (sub-license arrangement)
2. Setup cost: €15,000-€60,000 (license included)
3. Monthly fees: €5,000-€15,000 plus 15-30% revenue share
4. Time to launch: 4-8 weeks
5. Customization: Limited to branding and templates
6. Exit value: Minimal (you don't own the core assets)

#### The inflection point

White label wins below €100,000 monthly NGR. Above €200,000 NGR, turnkey becomes significantly more economical. The crossover happens faster if you're targeting regulated markets that require your own license anyway.

#### Choose turnkey if

You have €300,000+ capital, industry experience, target regulated markets, plan to build a sellable asset, or expect to exceed €200,000 monthly NGR within 2 years.

#### Choose white label if

You're new to iGaming, testing a market, have limited capital, or prioritize speed over long-term ownership.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### When does turnkey become more profitable than white label?

Turnkey typically becomes more profitable when you're consistently generating €150,000-€200,000+ monthly NGR. At this point, the savings on revenue share outweigh the higher operational costs.

#### Break-even calculation

- **White label at €200k NGR:** 20% revenue share = €40,000/month to provider
- **Turnkey at €200k NGR:** 3% revenue share + €15k platform fee = €21,000/month total
- **Monthly savings:** €19,000
- **Payback on extra setup costs (€150k difference):** ~8 months

#### Factors that accelerate turnkey profitability

1. **Regulated market targets:** UK, Germany, Ontario, US states require your own license regardless. White label isn't an option
2. **Multiple brand strategy:** Running 2-3 brands on one license spreads fixed costs
3. **High player LTV markets:** VIP-focused operations where margins matter more

#### Factors that favor staying white label longer

- Uncertain market fit (still testing)
- Limited operational capacity
- Cash flow constraints

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## How long does it take to launch a turnkey casino?

Turnkey launches typically take 2-6 months from contract signing to accepting players, compared to 4-8 weeks for white label. The platform configuration is similar—the license acquisition is what extends the timeline.

#### Realistic timeline breakdown

1. **Platform selection and contract:** 2-4 weeks. Due diligence, negotiation, legal review
2. **License application:** 2-4 months. Curacao 6-8 weeks, Malta 3-6 months, UK 4-6 months
3. **Platform configuration:** 4-8 weeks. Runs parallel to licensing in most cases
4. **Game and payment integration:** 4-8 weeks. Negotiating your own contracts takes longer
5. **Testing and compliance review:** 2-4 weeks. More rigorous when you hold the license
6. **Soft launch:** 1-2 weeks. Limited rollout before full launch

#### What drives timeline variance

- **Jurisdiction choice:** Curacao is fastest (6-8 weeks), Malta/UK take 3-6 months
- **Existing industry experience:** Regulators scrutinize first-time operators more closely
- **Corporate structure complexity:** Multi-jurisdictional setups add time
- **Customization level:** Heavy customization extends configuration phase

#### How to accelerate

1. Start license application immediately—don't wait for platform selection
2. Have all corporate documents, financial statements, and background checks ready
3. Use the provider's pre-integrated game and payment partners initially
4. Accept default configurations and customize post-launch

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### Do I need my own gambling license for a turnkey platform?

Yes—that's the defining characteristic of turnkey. You must obtain and hold your own gambling license, which means going through the full regulatory application process, meeting ongoing compliance requirements, and maintaining good standing with the regulator.

#### What license acquisition involves

1. Choose jurisdiction (Curacao, Malta, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, UK, US states)
2. Form a legal entity that meets jurisdictional requirements
3. Prepare extensive documentation (business plans, financials, AML policies)
4. Submit application and pay fees (€80,000-€300,000+)
5. Undergo personal background checks for key personnel
6. Demonstrate technical compliance and responsible gambling measures
7. Wait for approval (6 weeks to 6+ months depending on jurisdiction)

#### Why this matters

- **Market access:** Your license determines where you can legally operate
- **Banking and payments:** PSPs prefer operators with their own licenses
- **Business value:** An operating license is a valuable, sellable asset
- **Regulatory relationship:** You're directly accountable, not hiding behind a provider

#### Common jurisdictions for turnkey operators

- **Curacao:** Fastest, cheapest (€80k), broad market access but limited reputation
- **Malta (MGA):** Gold standard for EU, respected (€180k+), 3-6 month process
- **Gibraltar:** Premium tier, limited new licenses available
- **Isle of Man:** Strong reputation, zero gaming tax, good for scaling
- **UK (UKGC):** Required for UK market, most rigorous requirements

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## What are the risks and downsides of a turnkey platform?

Turnkey's advantages (ownership, control, better economics at scale) come with real operational challenges that white label operators never face.

#### Genuine disadvantages

1. **Higher upfront capital requirement:** You need €200,000-€500,000+ to launch properly. Undercapitalized turnkey operations fail more often than undercapitalized white labels because the fixed cost base is higher.

2. **Licensing complexity and risk:** You're directly responsible for regulatory compliance. License revocation or suspension means your entire operation stops. There's no provider umbrella to protect you.

3. **Technical expertise required:** You need in-house or contracted technical resources for integration maintenance, troubleshooting, and updates. White label providers handle this for you.

4. **Longer time to market:** 2-6 months vs. 4-8 weeks means competitors can establish themselves while you're still launching. First-mover advantage matters in new markets.

5. **Vendor relationships are your problem:** You negotiate directly with game providers, PSPs, and other suppliers. Less leverage than large providers who aggregate volume.

6. **Scaling is an integration problem:** Adding new providers, launching additional brands, or entering new jurisdictions multiplies configuration and compliance complexity.

Despite these challenges, turnkey is the right choice for operators building long-term, scalable businesses who have the capital and expertise to manage complexity.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What are red flags when choosing a turnkey provider?

The biggest warning signs are unrealistic timeline promises, vague technical documentation, and providers who downplay licensing complexity. These indicate either inexperience or misaligned incentives.

#### Red flags to watch for

1. **"Launch in 30 days" promises:** Including licensing, 30 days is impossible for a legitimate turnkey. This suggests they're conflating turnkey with white label.
2. **No reference clients with their own licenses:** Ask specifically for operators running on their own license, not sub-licensed under the provider.
3. **Vague source code terms:** If you're paying for turnkey, clarify exactly what code access you get. "Full ownership" often has asterisks.
4. **Limited game provider portfolio:** Fewer than 50 integrated providers suggests a less mature platform.
5. **No compliance support:** Legitimate providers help with license applications, not just sell software.
6. **Unclear exit terms:** What happens if you want to switch platforms? Can you take your integrations?

#### Due diligence essentials

1. Request a technical architecture review with your own developer
2. Speak with 3+ operators who've been live for 12+ months
3. Verify the provider's own regulatory standing and history
4. Have a gaming lawyer review all contracts before signing

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What mistakes do operators make with turnkey platforms?

The most expensive mistake is underestimating operational complexity. Turnkey gives you control—but that control comes with responsibility that catches first-time license holders off guard.

#### Common mistakes

1. **Underestimating compliance burden:** Your own license means your own compliance team, your own audits, your own regulatory reporting. Budget €5,000-€15,000/month minimum for compliance resources.

2. **Choosing the cheapest provider:** A €30,000 turnkey platform often means limited integrations, weak support, and technical debt you'll pay for later. The €80,000 option usually costs less over 3 years.

3. **Skipping the technical team:** You can't run turnkey without technical resources. At minimum, contract 20-40 hours/month of developer time for maintenance.

4. **Wrong jurisdiction choice:** Choosing Curacao because it's cheap when your target players are in Germany means you can't actually serve your market legally.

5. **Launching before you're ready:** Pressure to recoup investment leads to premature launches. A broken first impression loses players forever.

#### How to avoid these

Build a detailed 18-month operational plan including compliance, technical, and support headcount before committing. If the math doesn't work with proper resources, consider white label until you can afford turnkey properly.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## Who are the top turnkey casino providers in 2026?

The leading turnkey providers are GR8 Tech, SOFTSWISS, EveryMatrix, Digitain, and NuxGame, but "best" depends on your target markets, technical requirements, and growth trajectory.

#### Provider overview

1. **GR8 Tech:** Best for operators wanting maximum control and scalability. Strengths: 99.96% uptime, comprehensive all-in-one solution (casino, sports, CRM, risk management), modern mobile-first design. Limitations: Premium pricing, may be overkill for smaller operations. Price range: €80k-€150k+ setup.

2. **SOFTSWISS:** Best for crypto-native and European operators. Strengths: 36,000+ games from 300+ providers, pioneering crypto integration, strong data automation. Limitations: Waitlist for new operators, higher tier pricing. Price range: €60k-€120k setup.

3. **EveryMatrix:** Best for operators needing modular flexibility. Strengths: CasinoEngine aggregates 200+ providers, fully managed sportsbook (OddsMatrix), excellent for multi-brand strategies. Limitations: Complex for beginners, enterprise-focused pricing. Price range: €80k-€180k setup.

4. **Digitain:** Best for sports-first operators adding casino. Strengths: Strong sportsbook heritage, good for emerging markets. Limitations: Casino secondary to sports focus. Price range: €50k-€100k setup.

5. **NuxGame:** Best for balanced casino-sports operations. Strengths: All-in-one at mid-tier pricing, good for first-time turnkey operators. Limitations: Less established than tier-1 competitors. Price range: €40k-€80k setup.

#### How to actually choose

1. Define your primary vertical (casino-first vs. sports-first)
2. List your target jurisdictions—not all providers support all markets
3. Evaluate the game portfolio depth for your player demographics
4. Compare total 3-year cost including all integrations and support
5. Test the back-office extensively before committing

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What about turnkey platforms for crypto casinos?

Crypto-focused turnkey platforms are a growing segment, offering faster player onboarding and lower payment costs—but with distinct regulatory and operational considerations.

#### Crypto-specific advantages

1. Faster KYC with reduced friction (often email-only for lower tiers)
2. Near-instant withdrawals without banking delays
3. Lower transaction fees (1-2% vs. 3-7% for fiat)
4. Access to players in markets with restricted fiat payment options
5. "Provably fair" gaming as a marketing differentiator

#### Reality check

- Crypto player acquisition is intensely competitive with established brands
- Regulatory landscape is tightening. Some jurisdictions now require crypto-specific licenses
- Volatility risk: player deposits in BTC, you pay providers in EUR
- Fiat support is increasingly expected even at "crypto" casinos

#### Leading crypto-capable turnkey providers

- **SOFTSWISS:** Handles 50%+ of crypto casino volume globally, crypto-native since early days
- **GR8 Tech:** Full crypto wallet integration, modern infrastructure
- **NuxGame:** Good crypto support at mid-tier pricing

Most successful crypto casinos now operate as "crypto-first but fiat-friendly"—accepting both to maximize addressable market.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### How is the turnkey platform market changing in 2026?

The turnkey market is professionalizing rapidly, with consolidation among providers and rising expectations from operators. The days of basic "software in a box" are ending.

#### Key trends

1. **AI integration becoming standard:** Personalization engines, fraud detection, and bonus optimization are moving from "premium feature" to expected capability. Providers without AI tools are falling behind.

2. **Modular architecture dominance:** Operators want to mix best-of-breed components rather than accept monolithic solutions. Providers are unbundling to allow more flexibility.

3. **Compliance automation:** Regulatory reporting, responsible gambling triggers, and AML monitoring are increasingly automated. Manual compliance processes are becoming unacceptable.

4. **Mobile-native expectations:** 75%+ of traffic is mobile. Platforms not designed mobile-first are struggling to compete.

5. **US market preparation:** More providers are building US-compliant infrastructure anticipating continued state-by-state legalization. This is raising technical standards industry-wide.

6. **Consolidation:** Smaller providers are being acquired or exiting. Expect 20-30% fewer independent turnkey vendors by 2027.

#### What this means for operators

Higher baseline expectations, more sophisticated tooling available, but also higher minimum investment to be competitive. The gap between professional and amateur operations is widening.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### How do I know if my turnkey casino is performing well?

Track unit economics and operational efficiency, not just top-line revenue. With turnkey's higher fixed costs, margin management matters more than with white label.

#### Key metrics to monitor

1. **Revenue per employee/contractor:** Should improve over time as you scale; stagnation suggests operational bloat
2. **Cost per acquisition (CPA):** Healthy range €80-€180, warning sign above €250
3. **Player lifetime value (LTV):** Healthy range €250-€600, warning sign below €180
4. **LTV:CPA ratio:** Should be 3:1 or better; below 2:1 is unsustainable
5. **Gross margin (NGR minus direct costs):** Healthy range 65-80%, warning sign below 55%
6. **Technical uptime:** Should exceed 99.5%; below 99% indicates platform problems

#### Turnkey-specific metrics

- **Compliance cost as % of NGR:** Should decrease as you scale; above 8% at €200k+ NGR suggests inefficiency
- **Integration maintenance hours:** Track time spent on technical fixes; rising trend indicates platform issues
- **Provider contract terms:** Are you improving rates as volume grows? You have leverage now.

#### When to worry

Gross margin declining despite revenue growth, compliance costs not scaling down, technical issues requiring increasing attention.
