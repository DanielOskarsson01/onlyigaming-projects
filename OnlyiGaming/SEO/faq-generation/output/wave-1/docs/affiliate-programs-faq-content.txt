**[H2 QUESTION]**

## What is an iGaming affiliate program?

An iGaming affiliate program is a structured partnership system where third-party marketers promote online casinos or sportsbooks in exchange for commissions. Affiliates drive traffic through websites, content, social media, or paid advertising, and get paid when players they refer sign up, deposit, or generate ongoing revenue for the operator.

Affiliate marketing drives 30-50% of new player acquisitions for most iGaming operators. It's the industry's dominant acquisition channel because it shifts risk from the operator to the affiliate: you pay for results, not advertising impressions.

#### How affiliate programs work

1. **Affiliate joins the program:** Signs up through your affiliate management system, agrees to terms
2. **Tracking links generated:** Each affiliate receives unique tracking URLs with parameters
3. **Affiliate promotes the brand:** Creates content, runs ads, or posts referral links
4. **Player clicks and registers:** Tracking system attributes the player to the affiliate
5. **Commission earned:** Affiliate receives payment based on the agreed model (CPA, RevShare, or Hybrid)

#### Key components

- **Tracking platform:** Software that monitors clicks, conversions, and player value across all traffic sources
- **Commission structure:** The payment model and rates offered to affiliates
- **Creative assets:** Banners, landing pages, and promotional materials
- **Reporting dashboard:** Real-time visibility for affiliates to track their performance
- **Fraud detection:** Systems to identify fake leads and protect against affiliate fraud

The affiliate program is only as good as its tracking accuracy. A player attributed to the wrong affiliate, or not attributed at all, creates disputes that damage relationships with your top partners.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## How much do affiliate programs cost to run?

Running an affiliate program involves commission payouts (your largest variable cost), platform fees, and operational overhead. Total cost typically runs 25-45% of player NGR when you factor in all expenses, not just commission rates.

#### Commission costs (2026)

1. **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):** $50-$500+ per depositing player. Higher for regulated markets—UK and European players command $200-$400 CPA, while emerging markets run $50-$150
2. **Revenue share:** 20-50% of player NGR, ongoing for player lifetime. Standard range is 25-35%, premium affiliates negotiate 40-50%
3. **Hybrid deals:** $100-$200 CPA upfront plus 10-25% ongoing revenue share. Balances immediate cost with long-term alignment

#### Platform and operational costs

- **Affiliate software:** €500-€5,000/month depending on features and scale. Enterprise platforms like Income Access or JEBS cost more than SaaS solutions like Scaleo
- **Affiliate management staff:** €40,000-€80,000/year per manager. Most programs need 1 manager per 100-200 active affiliates
- **Creative production:** €5,000-€20,000/year for banners, landing pages, and promotional materials
- **Compliance and legal:** €10,000-€30,000/year for affiliate agreement reviews, regulatory compliance, and dispute resolution

#### The math operators get wrong

Advertising a "35% revenue share" sounds expensive until you compare it to paid acquisition. If your average player LTV is €800 and you're paying 35% RevShare, your effective acquisition cost is €280. Paid ads (Google, Meta) for iGaming often run €300-€600 per depositing player in regulated markets—with no ongoing relationship value.

The real cost risk is negative carryover in RevShare deals. If a player wins big one month, that loss carries forward, meaning you pay commission on subsequent losses until the deficit is cleared. Some operators cap negative carryover; others don't.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What are the hidden costs of affiliate programs?

The advertised commission rate is typically 60-70% of your actual affiliate program costs. Factor in fraud, compliance, and operational overhead for realistic budgeting.

#### Commonly overlooked costs

1. **Affiliate fraud losses:** Estimated at $84 billion globally in 2023 across all industries. iGaming sees significant self-referral, multi-accounting, and bonus abuse driven through affiliate channels. Budget 5-15% of commission payouts for fraud-related losses
2. **Negative carryover exposure:** Revenue share deals where player losses don't cover commission can accumulate deficits. Some operators absorb €50,000-€200,000 in negative balances annually
3. **Compliance monitoring:** Affiliates making unauthorized claims, targeting restricted markets, or violating advertising standards create regulatory exposure. Manual monitoring or automated compliance tools cost €1,000-€5,000/month
4. **Payment processing fees:** Paying hundreds of affiliates across multiple countries incurs 2-4% in transaction fees. Monthly payroll can run €500-€2,000 in processing alone
5. **Legal disputes:** Affiliate disagreements over attribution, commission calculations, or termination can cost €5,000-€30,000 in legal fees per dispute

#### The regulatory cost nobody mentions

UK law now makes operators legally responsible for affiliate misconduct. If an affiliate runs misleading advertising, targets self-excluded players, or violates advertising codes, the operator faces fines—not the affiliate. Compliance monitoring isn't optional anymore.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## What commission models should I offer affiliates?

The optimal commission structure depends on your growth stage, player LTV confidence, and target affiliate types. Most successful programs offer multiple options to attract different affiliate profiles.

#### Commission model comparison

1. **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**
   - How it works: Fixed payment per qualifying player (first deposit, minimum deposit, etc.)
   - Typical rates: $50-$500 depending on market and qualification criteria
   - Best for: Operators wanting predictable costs and new programs building affiliate relationships
   - Risk: You pay immediately; player may churn before recovering acquisition cost

2. **Revenue Share (RevShare)**
   - How it works: Percentage of player net gaming revenue, paid monthly for player lifetime
   - Typical rates: 20-50% of NGR
   - Best for: Operators confident in player LTV and wanting aligned incentives
   - Risk: Negative carryover exposure; high-value affiliates negotiate unsustainable rates

3. **Hybrid**
   - How it works: Smaller CPA upfront plus reduced ongoing revenue share
   - Typical rates: $100-$200 CPA + 10-25% RevShare
   - Best for: Balancing immediate cost control with long-term partnership
   - Risk: More complex to administer; affiliates may prefer pure models

#### What top affiliates actually want

Elite affiliates with proven traffic prefer revenue share because their player quality justifies it. New or unproven affiliates accept CPA because they need cash flow. Offering both attracts a diverse affiliate base.

#### Strategic considerations

- Start new affiliates on CPA until they prove player quality (3-6 months track record)
- Graduate proven affiliates to RevShare or Hybrid when their players demonstrate strong LTV
- Cap negative carryover at 2-3 months to limit downside exposure
- Consider sub-affiliate tiers for affiliates who recruit other affiliates (typically 5-10% of referred affiliate commissions)

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### How do I negotiate rates with top affiliates?

Top affiliates drive 10-30% of total program revenue but represent only 1-5% of your affiliate base. Negotiating their rates requires understanding their leverage and protecting your margins.

#### What top affiliates negotiate for

1. **Higher revenue share:** 40-50% vs. standard 25-35%
2. **Negative carryover caps:** Limits on how much deficit can accumulate
3. **Faster payment terms:** Weekly instead of monthly; lower minimum thresholds
4. **Exclusive bonuses:** Special offers only their players can access
5. **Direct account management:** Dedicated contact for support and optimization

#### How to negotiate effectively

1. **Know your numbers:** Calculate actual player LTV from their traffic before negotiating. If their players have 20% higher LTV than average, you can pay 20% more commission
2. **Tiered structures:** Offer escalating rates based on volume—35% base, 40% at 50+ depositors/month, 45% at 100+
3. **Performance bonuses:** One-time bonuses for hitting milestones keep base rates sustainable
4. **Exclusive content:** Provide unique games, bonuses, or features only their players access—value beyond commission
5. **Transparency:** Share (anonymized) player quality data so affiliates understand why rates are set where they are

#### When to walk away

If an affiliate demands rates that make their traffic unprofitable, let them go. Some affiliates shop for the highest commission regardless of brand fit. Those relationships rarely last and often bring lower-quality players anyway.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## What are the biggest challenges in running an affiliate program?

Affiliate programs offer scalable acquisition but come with operational complexity, fraud exposure, and regulatory risk that intensify as you scale.

#### Core challenges

**1. Affiliate fraud and quality control**

Affiliate fraud costs the iGaming industry hundreds of millions annually. Common schemes include self-referral (affiliates creating fake player accounts), cookie stuffing (artificially claiming attribution), and incentivized traffic (paying users to register without intent to play). Detection requires sophisticated tracking and manual review.

**2. Compliance and regulatory exposure**

Operators are increasingly liable for affiliate behavior. UK Gambling Commission holds licensees responsible for affiliate advertising. ASA complaints about affiliate content result in operator sanctions. Every affiliate is a potential compliance risk.

**3. Attribution disputes**

When multiple affiliates claim the same player, or tracking fails to attribute correctly, disputes damage relationships. Last-click attribution is simple but unfair to affiliates who influenced the player earlier in the journey.

**4. Negative player value**

Some affiliates drive players who deposit, claim bonuses, and withdraw without meaningful play. Bonus abuse funneled through affiliate channels erodes margins. Revenue share affiliates may have negative player value for months before becoming profitable.

**5. Affiliate churn and recruitment**

Top affiliates receive constant offers from competitors. Maintaining relationships requires ongoing engagement, competitive rates, and program value beyond commission. Meanwhile, recruiting new quality affiliates is increasingly competitive.

#### The challenge nobody talks about

Managing a large affiliate program is operationally intensive. 500+ active affiliates means constant communication, payment processing, dispute resolution, and relationship management. Staff costs often exceed commission savings from in-house vs. managed programs.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What is affiliate fraud and how do I prevent it?

Affiliate fraud involves affiliates generating fake or manipulated referrals to earn commissions without delivering legitimate players. Industry estimates suggest 5-30% of affiliate traffic contains some form of fraud, costing operators billions annually.

#### Common fraud types

1. **Self-referral:** Affiliates create player accounts under their own tracking links, often with multiple identities
2. **Cookie stuffing:** Placing tracking cookies on users without their knowledge to claim attribution for organic signups
3. **Incentivized traffic:** Paying users to register or deposit with no intent to play (often bonus abuse coordination)
4. **Click fraud:** Bots or click farms generating fake clicks to inflate performance metrics
5. **Multi-accounting rings:** Coordinated creation of multiple accounts to exploit bonuses, attributed to affiliate tracking

#### Prevention strategies

1. **Device fingerprinting:** Identify multiple accounts from the same device or browser configuration
2. **IP analysis:** Flag registrations from data centers, VPNs, or unusually concentrated geographic patterns
3. **Deposit-to-play ratios:** Players who deposit and immediately withdraw, or never play, indicate fraud
4. **Velocity monitoring:** Sudden spikes in an affiliate's conversions warrant investigation
5. **Commission holdbacks:** Delay final payment 30-60 days to allow fraud detection before payout
6. **Manual review thresholds:** Affiliates exceeding certain volumes trigger human review before payment

#### The 80/20 of fraud prevention

Most fraud comes from a small percentage of affiliates. Implement tiered monitoring: light review for established partners with clean history, intensive scrutiny for new affiliates and those showing warning signs. Automated systems flag; humans investigate.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What are red flags when evaluating affiliates?

Not all affiliate traffic is equal. Some affiliates consistently deliver high-value players; others send bonus abusers, fraudsters, or players who churn immediately. Identifying red flags early protects your program.

#### Warning signs in affiliate applications

1. **Vague traffic sources:** "Social media" or "SEO" without specifics suggests they don't control meaningful traffic
2. **No existing web presence:** Affiliates without visible websites, social accounts, or content presence may be planning fraud
3. **Unrealistic volume promises:** Claims of thousands of depositors monthly from a new affiliate usually indicate incentivized or fraudulent traffic
4. **Requests for special tracking:** Wanting sub-IDs, postback URLs, or pixel access beyond standard needs can indicate technical fraud setups
5. **Payment urgency:** Pressure for immediate payment or unusually short payment terms

#### Red flags in active affiliate performance

1. **Abnormal conversion rates:** Standard click-to-registration is 2-8%. Rates above 20% suggest cookie stuffing or incentivized traffic
2. **Deposit-to-play ratio:** Players who deposit but generate minimal play indicate bonus abuse or fraud
3. **High chargeback rates:** Traffic with elevated chargebacks suggests stolen payment methods or buyer's remorse from misleading advertising
4. **Concentrated player origins:** All players from a single IP range, device type, or region (when affiliate claims broader reach)
5. **Sudden volume spikes:** Traffic increasing 5-10x overnight without explanation warrants investigation

#### Due diligence process

Before approving affiliates: verify their claimed traffic sources exist, check their domain registration history, search for complaints from other operators, and start them on CPA (not RevShare) until they establish a clean track record.

**[H2 QUESTION]**

## Who are the top affiliate program software providers?

The leading affiliate software platforms are Scaleo, Affilka by SOFTSWISS, PartnerMatrix, Income Access, and Cellxpert. Choice depends on your scale, budget, and whether you need standalone software or a managed program.

#### Provider overview

**Managed programs:** Higher cost (20-40% markup on commissions) but includes affiliate recruitment, relationship management, and optimization. Best for operators without dedicated affiliate team.

#### How to evaluate

Request demos from 3-4 providers, test tracking accuracy with controlled campaigns, verify fraud detection capabilities, and confirm integration with your platform. The cheapest software costs more if it misattributes players or misses fraud.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### What mistakes do operators make with affiliate programs?

The most expensive mistake is treating all affiliates equally. Successful programs recognize that 10-20% of affiliates generate 80% of value and manage accordingly.

#### Common mistakes

1. **One-size-fits-all commission structures:** Offering the same rate to every affiliate regardless of traffic quality and volume leaves money on the table with top performers and overpays mediocre ones

2. **Ignoring compliance monitoring:** Assuming affiliates follow the rules leads to regulatory fines when they don't. One rogue affiliate's misleading advertising can cost you your license

3. **Delayed payments eroding trust:** Paying late or disputing commissions for legitimate traffic drives top affiliates to competitors. Reputation in affiliate circles spreads fast

4. **No negative carryover limits:** Unlimited negative carryover in RevShare deals can leave you paying nothing to affiliates for months, destroying relationships even when their overall traffic is valuable

5. **Neglecting affiliate communication:** Top affiliates expect regular updates, performance insights, and relationship investment. Treating them as transactional vendors loses their loyalty

6. **Underinvesting in fraud detection:** The 10-20% of traffic that's fraudulent seems manageable until you calculate annual cost. €50,000 in prevented fraud pays for sophisticated detection systems

#### The strategic mistake

Many operators view affiliate programs as "set and forget" after launch. The programs that outperform treat affiliate management as an active marketing discipline requiring continuous optimization, relationship building, and competitive positioning.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### How do I recruit quality affiliates?

Quality affiliate recruitment requires understanding where valuable affiliates operate, what they want beyond commission rates, and how to differentiate your program in a competitive market.

#### Where to find quality affiliates

1. **iGaming affiliate conferences:** iGB Affiliate, SiGMA, and affiliate-focused events are where top affiliates meet operators. In-person relationships convert at higher rates than cold outreach
2. **Competitor analysis:** Identify who's promoting competitors successfully. Many affiliates work with multiple brands and will add programs that offer competitive terms
3. **Niche content sites:** Quality affiliates often run SEO-focused comparison sites, casino review portals, or game guides. Search for sites ranking for your target keywords
4. **Affiliate networks:** Networks like Income Access, Affiliate Guard Dog's forums, and industry communities connect operators with vetted affiliates
5. **Existing player referrals:** High-value players often have networks. Referral bonuses for player-to-affiliate conversion can work

#### What attracts quality affiliates (beyond commission)

1. **Reliable tracking:** Affiliates won't promote brands where they don't trust attribution accuracy
2. **Fast payments:** Net-30 is standard; net-15 or weekly payment options attract top performers
3. **Exclusive offers:** Player bonuses that only their traffic can access improve their conversion
4. **Responsive management:** Dedicated affiliate manager contact who responds within 24 hours
5. **Brand reputation:** Affiliates protect their audience relationships. They won't promote brands with player complaints

#### The recruitment pitch

Lead with what makes your brand convert, not just commission rates. Player retention rates, average LTV, and exclusive features give affiliates confidence their traffic will generate ongoing revenue.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### How is the affiliate marketing landscape changing in 2026?

The affiliate landscape is consolidating around compliance, quality measurement, and sophisticated attribution while regulatory pressure increases operator liability for affiliate behavior.

#### Key trends

**1. Operator liability for affiliate conduct**

UK Gambling Commission and other regulators now hold operators responsible for affiliate advertising. Fines for misleading affiliate content fall on the licensee, not the affiliate. This is driving investment in compliance monitoring and affiliate vetting.

**2. Shift toward quality metrics**

CPA-only deals are declining as operators prioritize player lifetime value over volume. Revenue share and hybrid models align affiliate incentives with player quality. Expect tighter player value requirements for commission payment.

**3. Consolidation of affiliate networks**

Smaller affiliates struggle to compete with SEO-dominant media companies. The affiliate landscape is consolidating around larger networks and media buyers with sophisticated traffic capabilities. Operator programs need strategies for both enterprise affiliates and long-tail niche sites.

**4. Influencer and streaming integration**

Twitch streamers, YouTube creators, and social media influencers operate as affiliates with different management needs. Influencer-driven traffic often has higher trust but requires different creative assets and compliance monitoring.

**5. Privacy and tracking challenges**

Cookie deprecation and privacy regulations complicate attribution. Server-side tracking, first-party data strategies, and contextual attribution are becoming necessary for accurate measurement.

#### What this means for operators

Invest in compliance monitoring infrastructure now. Build relationships with quality affiliates before competitors lock them into exclusives. Diversify beyond traditional SEO affiliates into influencer and content partnerships.

**[H3 QUESTION]**

### How do I know if my affiliate program is performing well?

Track program profitability, affiliate engagement metrics, and player quality—not just traffic volume. Many programs report growth while actually declining in value.

#### Key metrics to monitor

1. **Player LTV by affiliate:** Calculate actual player value per affiliate source. Some affiliates deliver 2-3x average LTV; others bring bonus abusers with negative value
2. **Commission efficiency:** Total commission paid divided by player NGR generated. Healthy range is 25-35%; above 40% suggests overpayment or fraud
3. **Active affiliate rate:** Percentage of registered affiliates generating traffic. Industry average is 10-20%; below 10% indicates recruitment or engagement problems
4. **Fraud detection rate:** Percentage of flagged/rejected commissions. Some fraud is normal (5-10%); too little suggests detection gaps; too much suggests poor affiliate vetting
5. **Top affiliate concentration:** Revenue percentage from top 10 affiliates. Above 50% creates dependency risk; diversification reduces vulnerability

#### Warning signs

- Declining player LTV while volume increases (quality dropping)
- Rising chargeback rates from affiliate traffic
- Increasing commission disputes with established affiliates
- Top affiliates leaving for competitors
- Compliance issues traced to affiliate marketing

#### Benchmarking

- Affiliate-sourced players should have LTV within 80-120% of direct traffic
- Commission as percentage of NGR: 25-35% is healthy
- First-deposit to active player conversion: 60-70% is strong
- 90-day player retention from affiliate traffic: should match or exceed other channels
