        "text": "A sportsbook platform is specialized software infrastructure that powers sports betting operations, handling live odds, risk management, bet settlement, and market coverage for thousands of sporting events. Core components include odds engine (real-time pricing from data providers), trading and risk management, low-latency bet acceptance, market coverage (50,000+ events monthly), settlement engine, and player account management. The platform is only as good as its trading capability."

        "text": "Costs range from €5,000-€20,000/month for white-label to €100,000-€500,000+ for turnkey or custom development. Breakdown: platform fee €5,000-€50,000/month, setup €10,000-€100,000, revenue share 10-25% of NGR, odds/data feeds €5,000-€50,000/month, licensing €50,000-€300,000+, trading services €10,000-€50,000/month. Total first-year investment realistically runs €300,000-€2,000,000 including licensing and marketing."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Key differences: Casino earns from house edge with static probability and predictable margins, requiring game integration but no trading. Sportsbook earns from betting margins with dynamic probability requiring active trading and risk management. Sportsbook margins (1-3% net) are thinner than casino (3-8% net). Most successful operators offer both, choosing between combined platforms (simpler) or best-of-breed integration (better quality, more complexity)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Core challenges: trading and risk management (without AI automation, operators react too late to market movements), in-play latency (60-70% of handle requires sub-second response), sharp bettor management (profiling and appropriate limits), event traffic spikes (10-50x during major events), and data/streaming dependencies. Casino and sportsbook journeys remain siloed for most operators despite integration potential."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Three models: fully managed trading (outsource to Kambi, Sportradar MTS, Genius—fastest, predictable costs), hybrid (managed core markets plus in-house for specific sports), or in-house (€500,000+ annual investment, maximum control). Key capabilities: automated odds adjustment, liability control, bettor profiling, market suspension, arbitrage detection. Good trading shows margin volatility below 0.5 percentage points month-to-month."

Requirements: real-time data feeds (1-3 second refresh), low-latency bet acceptance (under 500ms), dynamic odds engine, live streaming (€5,000-€30,000/month), and scalable infrastructure for 10-50x traffic spikes. Challenges include data latency exploitation by sharps, automatic market suspension, and microbetting expansion requiring even faster infrastructure."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Common mistakes: ignoring trading costs (platform fee is 30-40% of total cost), overestimating margins (expect 1-3% not casino-like 5-8%), underestimating in-play importance (60-70% of handle), inadequate trading capability, ignoring bettor profiling, and single data provider dependency. The strategic mistake is treating sportsbook as 'casino with sports'—it's fundamentally different business with active trading against sophisticated bettors."

Due diligence: test during live events, request margin data from similar operators, verify redundancy, have trading expert evaluate odds competitiveness."
