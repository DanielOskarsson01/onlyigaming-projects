        "text": "iGaming payment processing refers to specialized financial infrastructure enabling online gambling operators to accept deposits and process withdrawals across multiple currencies, payment methods, and jurisdictions. It handles the €3.8+ trillion in annual payouts. Gambling is classified as 'high-risk' by banks, requiring specialized PSPs. Key components include payment gateway, multiple PSP integrations, multi-currency support, fraud detection, KYC/AML compliance, and smart routing optimization."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Payment processing fees typically run 2-5% of deposits plus €0.10-€0.50 per transaction, withdrawal fees, and chargeback costs of €15-€70 per dispute. Total payment costs including chargebacks and rolling reserves often consume 4-8% of gross deposits. Cards cost 2.5-3.5%, e-wallets 2-3%, bank transfers 1.5-2%, and cryptocurrency 0.5-1%. Rolling reserves of 5-10% held for 6 months impact cash flow significantly."

Budget for 4-8% of deposits total, not the quoted 2.5%."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Top operators negotiate rates 20-40% below published pricing through: multi-PSP setup (route to lowest-fee provider per transaction type), volume commitments (€500,000+ monthly for significant reductions), smart routing optimization (10-15% cost reduction), cryptocurrency integration (0.5-1% vs. 2.5-3.5% for cards—70% cost reduction reported), reducing chargebacks, negotiating rolling reserves after proving track record, and local acquiring to avoid cross-border fees."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Core challenges include: high-risk classification (limited provider options, higher fees—payment fraud up 90% in 2025), chargebacks threatening merchant accounts (Visa threshold 0.9%), regulatory restrictions varying by market (credit card bans in UK, Sweden from 2026), high decline rates (15-25% common with poor PSP setup), and cross-border complexity multiplying costs. Multi-PSP setups, smart routing, and cryptocurrency options help manage these issues."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Chargebacks occur when players dispute transactions with their bank, resulting in forced refunds plus €15-€70 fees per dispute. Gambling sees 2-3x higher rates than e-commerce. Prevention strategies: clear billing descriptors, strong KYC verification, documenting player activity, responsive support, velocity checks for unusual patterns, and 3D Secure authentication. Visa threshold is 0.9%; exceeding triggers monitoring, fines, and potential account termination."

Withdrawals—e-wallets 0-24 hours, bank transfers 1-3 business days, cards 2-5 business days, crypto 0-2 hours. Delays come from manual review queues, KYC verification, bonus verification, and bank processing. Instant withdrawals have become a marketing differentiator—3+ day withdrawals put you at significant competitive disadvantage."

Challenges: volatility risk, increasing regulatory requirements, limited mainstream adoption. Most successful approach: hybrid accepting both crypto and fiat, with instant conversion to reduce volatility exposure."
