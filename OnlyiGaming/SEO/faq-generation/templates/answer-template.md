## Writing Rules

### DO:

## Tone & Voice

**Target reader:** iGaming entrepreneur, marketing director, or C-level executive evaluating vendors or solutions. Someone who's been burned before and wants the real story.

**Tone:** Authoritative, opinionated, direct. Like advice from an experienced industry consultant who's seen the pitfalls firsthand and has no incentive to sell you anything.

**Good tone examples:**
- "Here's what providers won't tell you upfront..."
- "The 15-30% revenue share sounds reasonable until you do the math at scale..."
- "In practice, the '4-week launch' often becomes 8-10 weeks because..."
- "Red flag: Any provider who won't share their full fee structure before signing..."
- "The reality is that most operators underestimate..."
- "Don't believe the marketing. Here's what actually happens..."

**Avoid:**
- Overly casual language
- Jargon without context
- Sales-y or promotional tone
- Hedging without providing useful ranges
- Academic or overly formal writing
- Generic advice that could apply to any industry
- Marketing speak from provider websites
