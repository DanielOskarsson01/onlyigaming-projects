# Commercial Status Tags (COMM-001 to COMM-004)

## Single Source of Truth

This file is the canonical reference for all commercial status tags. These tags distinguish editorial from paid content.

**Cardinality:** 1 per article. Single-select. Required.

**Legal requirement:** Distinguishing sponsored from editorial content is a legal and ethical obligation. Every published article must have exactly one COMM tag.

---

### COMM-001: Editorial
Independent editorial content produced without commercial influence. The default status for all news articles, analysis, and features written by the editorial team.

**Use when:** Content is produced independently by the editorial team with no commercial arrangement

---

### COMM-002: Sponsored
Paid content with editorial oversight. A commercial partner has paid for the content to be produced, but the editorial team maintains control over quality and accuracy. Must be clearly labeled to readers.

**Use when:** A company has paid for content creation, but editorial team wrote/edited it. Often includes "Sponsored by [Company]" label.

---

### COMM-003: Partner Content
Co-created content with a commercial partner. Both the editorial team and the partner contribute to the content. The partner has input on messaging but the publication maintains editorial standards.

**Use when:** Content is co-produced with a commercial partner, both parties have input. Often includes "In partnership with [Company]" label.

---

### COMM-004: Native Advertising
Advertiser-created content published on the platform. The commercial partner produces the content; the editorial team may review for quality but does not write it. Must be clearly distinguished from editorial content.

**Use when:** Content is written/produced by the advertiser, not the editorial team. Often includes "Advertiser content" or "Promoted" label.

## Relationship to TYPE-012 (Sponsored)

TYPE-012 indicates the **format** is sponsored content. COMM tags indicate the **commercial relationship**. They can overlap but serve different purposes:

- TYPE-012 + COMM-002: Sponsored article written by editorial team
- TYPE-005 + COMM-003: Analysis piece co-created with a partner
- TYPE-008 + COMM-004: Press release published as native advertising

COMM tags are always required. TYPE-012 is optional and only used when "sponsored" is the primary format descriptor.
