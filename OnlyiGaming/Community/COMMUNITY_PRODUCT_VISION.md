# Community Product Vision

## 1. Background

OnlyiGaming is building the definitive platform for the iGaming industry — a comprehensive ecosystem covering Directory, News, Events, Careers, Education, Consultants, and more.

Today, the platform serves a critical function: people come to find information. A company profile. A news article. A job listing. They find what they need and leave.

This is the "lookup site" problem. Valuable, but transactional. No reason to return daily. No stickiness. No loyalty beyond utility.

**Community is the missing piece.**

Community transforms OnlyiGaming from a resource you visit into a destination you belong to. From a tool into a home for the industry.

## 2. The Industry Problem

### Fragmented Communities

iGaming professionals are scattered across platforms:

- **WhatsApp groups** — Private, invite-only, hard to discover
- **Telegram channels** — Noisy, unstructured
- **LinkedIn** — Generic professional network, not iGaming-specific
- **Discord servers** — Gaming-focused, not professional
- **Industry Slack channels** — Company-specific silos

There is no unified, neutral hub where the entire industry connects.

### No Place to Build Your Brand

Professionals in iGaming want to be seen. They curate their reputation, share insights, position themselves as experts. But where?

- LinkedIn is too broad — your iGaming content competes with everyone's vacation photos
- WhatsApp groups are invisible — great discussions disappear into private chats
- Conference networking is ephemeral — connections fade after the event

There's no platform designed specifically for iGaming professionals to build visibility among their peers.

### AI Can't Replace Connection

AI can generate content, summaries, and recommendations. What it cannot generate: relationships, trust, peer recognition, or belonging.

The value of community isn't information — it's connection. And connection cannot be automated, copied, or commoditized.

## 3. Why People Will Participate

### Build Personal Brand

- Share expertise with the people who matter — industry peers
- Curate a professional profile visible to the right audience
- Get recognized for contributions, not just job titles

### Be Seen by Peers

- Highlighted posts, hot discussions, weekly top contributors
- Recognition transcends seniority — good ideas surface regardless of title
- Build reputation that follows you across the industry

### Connect with the Right People

- Find peers working on similar problems
- Discover potential partners, hires, mentors
- Access people you'd never meet otherwise

### Stay Informed Through Trusted Voices

- Follow people whose judgment you trust
- Get signal, not algorithmic noise
- Discussions provide context that articles can't

## 4. The Solution

### Community as a Layer, Not a Section

Community is not a separate destination on OnlyiGaming. It's the connective tissue that runs through everything.

**Wherever you are on the site, relevant community content appears:**

| You're viewing... | Community surfaces... |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Payment category page | Payment groups, tagged discussions, polls |
| News article | Comments, related posts, "Discuss in [Group]" |
| Company profile | Discussions about that company, reviews, Q&A |
| Event page | "Who's attending?", pre/post-event threads |
| Job listing | Company discussions, salary threads, interview experiences |
| Consultant profile | Reviews, recommendations, Q&A |

Site content feeds community. Community content enriches the site. They're inseparable.

### LinkedIn Meets Reddit, Built for iGaming

**From LinkedIn:**
- Professional profiles with real identity
- Personal brand building
- Network of connections you follow
- Visible career history and expertise

**From Reddit:**
- Topic-based groups and communities
- Discussions and threads
- Anonymous participation option

**Built specifically for iGaming:**
- Integrated with Directory, News, Events, Careers
- Industry-specific groups (Payments, CRM, Crypto Casino, Compliance, AI)
- Context that generic platforms can't provide

## 5. The Unique Value (USP)

### Connections Can't Be Copied

Competitors can replicate content. They can copy features. They cannot copy the relationships formed on the platform. Network effects compound over time — the more people participate, the more valuable participation becomes.

### The Only Neutral Industry Hub

OnlyiGaming serves the entire industry — operators, suppliers, affiliates, regulators, consultants. No single company agenda. No vendor bias. A genuine neutral ground.

### Human Relationships Beat AI Content

As AI-generated content floods the industry, human insight becomes more valuable, not less. Knowing who said something matters as much as what was said. Trust is built through interaction, not generation.

### One Home for Everything

Instead of checking LinkedIn for posts, WhatsApp for discussions, the news for updates, and email for messages — everything lives in one place, connected intelligently.

## 8. The Destination

When this vision is realized, OnlyiGaming becomes:

**The place you check every morning** — not for tasks, but to see what's happening

**The place you share wins** — because the right people will see it

**The place you ask questions** — because experts actually answer

**The place you build relationships** — that outlast any single job

**The place you return to daily** — because it's where your industry lives

---

*This is not a feature list. This is the foundation for making OnlyiGaming the home of the iGaming industry.*

## Notes for Future Work

When moving to detailed implementation, research needed for:

1. **Personal Profile Sections** — What content fields, layout, privacy options?
2. **Consultant Profile Sections** — Services, rates, booking, portfolio, reviews
3. **AI-Profiles (Unclaimed)** — Auto-generated profiles for industry people who haven't claimed their profile yet — what data, what limitations, how to prompt claiming?
