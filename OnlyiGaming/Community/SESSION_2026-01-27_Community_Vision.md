## Open Questions / Future Research

1. **Personal Profile Content Sections** - What content blocks should regular user profiles include?
2. **Consultant Profile Content Sections** - What additional elements for paid consultants?

- [ ] When ready: begin detailed profile research (personal vs consultant sections)
- [ ] Consider AI-profile strategy for unclaimed industry people

## Session Notes

This session took a collaborative, interview-style approach rather than having the agent produce analysis independently. The result is a vision document that reflects genuine strategic thinking and user-centered design considerations, positioning the community as a distinctive professional network for the iGaming industry.
