## Risk Mitigation

### Adoption Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Nobody posts | Seed with compelling content, incentivize early adopters |
| Competitors copy | Move fast, build network effects |
| Companies don't engage | Show ROI (lead gen, reputation management) |

### Quality Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Spam/fake reviews | LinkedIn verification, moderation, reputation penalties |
| Low-quality discussions | Highlight expert answers, gamify quality |
| Company manipulation | Clear rules, cannot remove negative reviews |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No monetization uptake | Prove value first, premium features tied to real benefits |
| Cannibalize Directory traffic | Integration makes both stronger |
| Moderation burden | Community self-moderation, AI flagging |
