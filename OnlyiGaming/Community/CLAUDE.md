# OnlyiGaming Community Section

## Project Overview
The Community section transforms OnlyiGaming from a "lookup site" to a **daily-use destination** for iGaming industry professionals. It provides neutral, authentic spaces for networking, discussion, and peer reviews.

**Priority**: Parallel Track (alongside Content-Pipeline, News, SEO)
**Status**: Planning Complete - Ready for Phase 1

Community fills the human connection gap that AI cannot replace.
