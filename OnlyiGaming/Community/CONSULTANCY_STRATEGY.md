# Consultancy Strategy

## Vision

Transform OnlyiGaming's consultant section from a static directory into a **marketplace with instant booking** — speed dating for professional services.

---

## The Problem Today

Finding and hiring a consultant is friction-heavy:

1. Find them somehow (LinkedIn, referral, Google)
2. Email back and forth to schedule
3. 30-60 minute "discovery call" (both sides auditioning)
4. Still not sure if they're right
5. Maybe another call
6. Finally decide

Both sides waste time. Consultants spend hours on unpaid discovery calls. Clients can't quickly evaluate fit.

## The Solution: Paid Micro-Time

**With OnlyiGaming:**

1. Browse consultant profiles
2. Read their posts, see their reputation, check reviews
3. Buy 10 minutes — €20
4. In 10 minutes you KNOW: Do they understand my problem? Do I like how they think? Is there chemistry?
5. Decision made

**It's speed dating for professional services.**

## Context-Based Charging

Payment depends on **which hat someone is wearing**, not a fixed profile type.

Same person, same day, different contexts:

| Context | Suggestion | Payment |
|---------|------------|---------|
| You're researching a product they used | "Get real experience" | Paid |
| You're in the same interest group | "Fellow member" | Free |
| They viewed your company profile | "Interested in you" | Free |
| You need their professional expertise | "Consultant available" | Paid |
| You're both attending ICE | "Also going" | Free |

Users toggle what they charge for:
- "I have experience with these products: [list] — €15/10min"
- "I consult on: [topics] — €50/30min"
- "Peer connections: always free"

---

## Revenue Model

**Platform takes a cut of paid conversations.**

Details to determine:
- Percentage (15-25% range typical for marketplaces)
- Payment processing fees passed through or absorbed
- Payout timing (immediate, weekly, monthly)
- Minimum payout thresholds

---

## Relationship to Community

Consultancy marketplace is **enabled by community**, not separate from it:

- Reputation built through community participation
- Expertise demonstrated in discussions, not just claimed in bio
- Reviews tied to actual interactions on platform
- Trust established before first paid conversation

## Notes for Future Work

1. **Profile sections** — What fields for consultants? Services, rates, portfolio, availability?
2. **Booking flow** — UX for instant vs. scheduled bookings
3. **Video/voice integration** — Built-in or external (Zoom, Meet)?
4. **Project scope expansion** — How does a 10-min call become a 10-week engagement?
5. **Dispute resolution** — What if client is unhappy with paid time?
6. **Consultant onboarding** — How to seed initial consultant supply?
