# Discovery Questions: Community Partner Evaluation

**Purpose:** Understand potential partner's vision, commitment, and alignment before discussing commercial terms.

## A. What They Bring

### Their Network
- How many people are in your WhatsApp groups currently?
- How would you describe the composition? (C-level, mid-management, operators, vendors?)
- What's the activity level? Messages per day/week?
- How long have you been curating these groups?
- What's your LinkedIn reach? Followers, typical post engagement?

### Their Expertise
- Have you built digital community features before, or primarily managed chat groups?
- What community platforms have you studied or admired?
- What do you think makes a community succeed vs. fail?
- What's your experience with community moderation at scale?

## B. Their Vision

### Big Picture
- When you imagine this community in 2 years, what does it look like?
- What's the single most important thing it should do for members?
- How do you see the relationship between community and events?

### Features and Priorities
- What features do you think are essential at launch?
- What would you build in Year 1 vs. Year 2?
- How do you think about profiles? What should they include?
- What makes someone come back daily vs. once a month?

### Alignment Check
- We see community as "glue" across the whole site, not just a separate section. How does that match your thinking?
- We want to be platform-neutral — promote all events, all companies equally. How do you feel about that?
- What role should your events company play in the community?

## C. Their Commitment

### Time and Resources
- Who from your team would work on this? Full-time or part-time?
- How many hours per week realistically?
- Is this your primary focus or one of several projects?

### Exclusivity
- Are you having similar conversations with other platforms?
- If we move forward, would you commit exclusively to OnlyiGaming?

### Long-term Thinking
- Where do you see your events business in 3 years?
- How does this partnership fit into your overall strategy?
- What would make you consider this a success vs. failure?

---

## D. Working Style

### Collaboration
- How do you like to work with partners? Hands-off or closely involved?
- How should we handle disagreements on priorities or features?
- What's your communication style? (Calls, async, weekly syncs?)

### Decision Making
- If we disagree on a feature direction, how should we resolve it?
- What decisions would you expect to make independently vs. together?

---

## E. Risk and Commitment Signals

### Skin in the Game
- What are you personally risking if this doesn't work?
- What would you be giving up to commit to this partnership?

### Red Flag Detection
- What's the biggest thing that could go wrong with this partnership?
- What would make you want to exit?
- Have you had partnerships fail before? What happened?

---

## F. Success Definition

### Metrics
- How would you measure if the community is succeeding?
- What numbers would you be proud of in Year 1?
- What's more important: user count or engagement depth?

### Accountability
- What would you commit to delivering in the first 6 months?
- How should we hold each other accountable?

## Conversation Flow

1. **Open:** "We're excited about the potential, but want to make sure we're aligned before discussing terms."

2. **Their vision first:** Let them talk. See if it matches yours without leading them.

3. **Probe commitments:** Time, resources, exclusivity — are they all-in?

4. **Share your principles:** Platform neutrality, community as glue, engagement over vanity metrics.

5. **Watch for alignment:** Do they light up at your vision, or push back?

6. **Close:** "Let's both think about this and reconvene. No rush to finalize terms."

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Vague about group size or engagement metrics
- Events-first language (sees community as marketing channel)
- Resistance to platform neutrality
- Unclear on time commitment
- Pushing for quick commercial commitment
- Can't articulate what success looks like beyond "more users"

---

## Green Flags

- Specific engagement metrics they track
- Excited about community-as-product, not just marketing
- Comfortable with platform neutrality
- Clear on who does what and time investment
- Asks thoughtful questions about your vision
- Willing to prove value before locking in terms
