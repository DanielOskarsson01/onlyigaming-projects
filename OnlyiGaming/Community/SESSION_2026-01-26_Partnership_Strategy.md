# Session: Community Partnership Strategy
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## Summary

Strategic thinking session exploring a potential community partnership for OnlyiGaming with a company that operates WhatsApp groups of C-level iGaming executives.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| More discovery needed before committing | Vision alignment unclear, need to understand partner's true motivations |
| Community is potentially the most important USP | Can't be copied like content; creates network effects and loyalty |
| Partner would direct, OnlyiGaming builds | User retains control of development, partner brings expertise |
| Platform neutrality is non-negotiable | All events/companies promoted equally, partner's events not favored |

## Value Exchange Clarified

**OnlyiGaming brings:**
- Development resources and funding
- Platform, brand, traffic, SEO
- Entire ecosystem of user segments (Careers, News, Directory, Consultants, Events)
- Network effects that make connections valuable

**Partner would bring:**
- C-level WhatsApp network
- Community management expertise
- Product direction for community features
- Marketing reach (different LinkedIn niche)
- Moderation and engagement

## Commercial Framework Discussed

- 50/50 revenue split on community ads/sponsorships
- All revenue reinvested in development initially
- Partner's events: can be "main sponsor" with clear labeling
- If community primarily drives their events: consider 30% revenue share
- Exit: KPI-based valuation of community section

## Risk Mitigations Identified

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Partner extracts value for events only | Engagement metrics, accountability, potential exit |
| Assets lost if partnership fails | Everything belongs to OnlyiGaming from day one |
| Partner leaves with users | Switching costs (history, gamification, connections) |
| Vision misalignment | Discovery call before committing |
| No money for breakup | Groups have no current revenue; relationships remain |

## Community Vision Articulated

### Core Concept
Community as "glue" connecting all site sections — not a siloed feature.

### Model
LinkedIn + Reddit hybrid for iGaming:
- Professional profiles with connections
- Posts, articles, discussions
- Groups and topic-based communities

### Integration Template
- Right-hand widget: relevant community content
- Below content: direct community features
- Consistent across all sections

### Success Metrics
- Daily/monthly active users
- Engagement depth (posts, comments, connections)
- Return visit rate
- Cross-section activity
- Organic growth

## Deliverables Created

1. **Community Strategy Vision** — Documented user's vision based on conversation
2. **Discovery Questions** — Comprehensive guide for partner evaluation call

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Schedule exploratory call with potential partner
2. [ ] Finalize internal community vision document
3. [ ] Use discovery questions to assess alignment
4. [ ] Compare visions after call
5. [ ] Only then negotiate commercial terms

## Open Questions for Future Sessions

- What's the minimum viable community feature set?
- How to measure partner contribution vs organic growth?
- What's Plan B if this partner doesn't work out?
- How does community roadmap fit with Content Pipeline, News, SEO priorities?
