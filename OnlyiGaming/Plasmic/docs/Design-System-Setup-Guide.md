# Plasmic Design System Setup Guide

**Source**: Developer documentation (January 2026)
**Purpose**: Instructions for setting up the OnlyiGaming Design System in Plasmic

---

## Overview

This guide covers setting up a Design System in Plasmic that can be imported into any project. The focus is on style tokens (atoms) that Plasmic supports.

---

## Step 1: Open Design System Project

1. Login to Plasmic
2. Open **OnlyiGaming Design System** project
3. This is a blank project used to setup a Design System that can be imported into any project

---

## Step 2: Style Tokens to Configure

Main task is setting up style tokens (atoms) currently supported in Plasmic:

| Token Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Colors** | Brand colors, semantic colors, UI colors |
| **Font sizes** | Typography scale |
| **Line height** | Text line spacing |
| **Opacity** | Transparency values |
| **Spacing** | Paddings, margins, dimensions |
| **Font family** | Typography fonts |

---

## Step 3: Learn Plasmic Concepts

Before configuring, understand these Plasmic functionalities:

| Concept | Documentation Link | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Style tokens | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/tokens/ | Reusable design values |
| Style presets | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/style-presets/ | Predefined style combinations |
| Variants | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/variants/ | Component state variations |
| Global variants | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/global-variants/ | App-wide state variations |
| Element variants | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/element-variants/ | Element-specific variations |
| Responsive design | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/responsive-design/ | Breakpoint handling |
| Components | https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/components/ | Reusable UI elements |

**See also**: [Plasmic-Concepts-Reference.md](Plasmic-Concepts-Reference.md) for summarized documentation of each concept.

## Step 4: Add Style Tokens

1. In OnlyiGaming Design System project, go to **Assets** > **Style Tokens** (left sidebar)
2. Click the **Plus icon** next to each section to add tokens
3. Import values from Figma
4. Use naming structure similar to Figma for consistency

### Token Categories in Plasmic

- Color (0)
- Font Family (0)
- Font Size (0)
- Line Height (0)
- Opacity (0)
- Spacing (0)

---

## Step 5: Test and Continue

After tokens are imported:
1. Test the tokens in sample components
2. Continue with style presets and components
3. Import the Design System into the main OnlyiGaming project

---

## Notes

- Tokens defined here will be used across the entire project
- Keep naming consistent with Figma design files
- Design System project acts as single source of truth for styles
